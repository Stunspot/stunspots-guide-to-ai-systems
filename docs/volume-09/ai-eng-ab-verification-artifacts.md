# AI-ENG-AB — Verification Artifacts - Auditability, Reproducibility & Evidence Trails

## **Doctrinal Foundations: The Evidence Architecture Paradigm**

In high-dimensional artificial intelligence systems, production reliability cannot be governed or monitored by traditional application performance monitoring (APM) paradigms.1 While legacy web architectures treat system health as a binary or scalar infrastructure state defined by hardware allocation, network latency, and HTTP status codes, modern multi-agent execution loops and probabilistic large language models (LLMs) break these assumptions.1 A system can return an infrastructure-level successful HTTP 200 payload that contains a complete structural schema failure, an unauthorized tool execution, a cross-tenant data leak, or an ungrounded factual confabulation.1 Conversely, optimal hardware utilization and high throughput can coexist with red behavioral and meaning-level system states.2 This discrepancy establishes the Green Dashboard Fallacy: the diagnostic error of assuming an AI system is operating correctly simply because its underlying servers and APIs are online and available.1

To resolve this visibility deficit, modern systems architectures isolate monitoring concerns across distinct operational layers.1 While strategic telemetry (AI-ENG-Z) functions as the sensor network capturing execution spans 1, and evaluation frameworks (AI-ENG-AA) act as the regression testing pipeline 1, this document defines the architecture of verification artifacts (AI-ENG-AB).1 Verification artifacts are the durable, privacy-governed, and tamper-evident evidence objects required to reconstruct, audit, and reproduce the behavior of probabilistic systems after the fact.3

This architecture is governed by the core doctrine: every consequential AI output or action must leave behind a replayable evidence trail.1 This trail must link the exact prompt template, model weights snapshot, retrieval context, tool payload, policy execution state, human modification, and final output in an unbroken, cryptographically signed chain of custody.1 The fundamental engineering question shifts from "did we record a log entry?" to "can the organization reconstruct the exact decision path from user input to final output or action, including the evidence, versions, state transitions, checks, edits, and approvals that shaped it?".1 Without this capability, compliance becomes guesswork, debugging degrades into digital archaeology, and the system cannot be safely governed.1

## **Logs-Traces-Artifacts-Evidence Taxonomy**

To establish a clear hierarchy, the following taxonomy contrasts these diagnostic layers across operational, technical, and evidentiary boundaries, proving why generic logs are insufficient for AI auditability:

| Layer | Technical Scope & Composition | Primary Operational Purpose | System Proof Capability | Architectural Limitations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Event Log** | Flat structured or unstructured events emitted by applications, services, or workers. | Debugging, operational status, exception capture, and coarse audit hints. | Shows that a code path emitted an event at a time. | Does not prove full context, prompt state, evidence, policy checks, user edits, or side effects. |
| **Metric** | Aggregated numeric counters, gauges, histograms, and time-series measurements. | Capacity planning, alerting, scaling, and SLO monitoring. | Shows rates, volumes, durations, and resource pressure. | Blind to semantic correctness, grounding, authorization, and user-visible truth. |
| **Execution Trace** | Parent-child span graph linking distributed work across model calls, retrieval, tools, queues, and services. | Latency analysis, causal path reconstruction, and system debugging. | Shows the causal execution path and timing relationships. | Often redacted, sampled, or incomplete for bulky or sensitive payloads. |
| **Span** | Atomic observable unit of work such as inference, retrieval, rerank, parser, tool call, guardrail, or review step. | Local timing, status, error, and attribute capture. | Shows what a specific execution step attempted and how it ended. | Does not by itself prove global policy state, source lineage, or final user-facing transformation. |
| **Verification Artifact** | Schema-validated evidence packet containing hashes, references, versions, decisions, state checks, and selected payload evidence. | Auditing a specific decision boundary or execution step. | Proves integrity of recorded inputs, outputs, parameters, and decisions to the degree captured. | Cannot prove uncaptured state; raw payload capture must be governed by privacy policy. |
| **Manifest** | Declarative version record for prompts, models, tools, dependencies, policies, routes, and environments. | Pinning expected system state and baseline capability configuration. | Shows what configuration was intended or eligible for execution. | Does not prove which dynamic inputs arrived or whether runtime behavior matched intent. |
| **Ledger** | Append-only record of actions, approvals, state transitions, tool calls, retries, and commit/verification status. | Sequencing, accountability, and action-state audit. | Shows logical progression and final known state of operations. | Does not automatically preserve full prompts, retrieved evidence, or rendered UI output. |
| **Snapshot** | Point-in-time capture or reference to context, retrieval state, memory, index version, tool state, or UI state. | Preserving what information was available at execution time. | Shows the evidence/context surface available to the system. | Storage-intensive; may require deduplication, redaction, and secure references. |
| **Diff** | Structural, textual, semantic, or field-level comparison between artifact versions. | Tracking edits, redactions, transformations, overrides, and regressions. | Shows exactly what changed between two captured states. | Does not explain why the change occurred unless linked to trace, policy, or reviewer artifacts. |
| **Evidence Trail** | Hash-linked sequence of artifacts, manifests, ledgers, snapshots, and diffs with retention and access policy. | Forensic reconstruction, compliance proof, replay, and dispute resolution. | Shows an integrity-protected chain of recorded evidence across a consequential workflow. | Tamper-evident, not omniscient; evidence quality depends on capture coverage and governance. |

Legacy logs are fundamentally insufficient for auditing probabilistic architectures.1 Recording that an API returned a response does not show the prompt template that generated it, the vector database coordinates that informed it, the safety policies that validated it, or the user edits that overrode it before execution.1 If an administrator cannot inspect these intermediate states, they cannot defend automated decisions to regulators, resolve disputes, or debug system drift.1

## **Replay and Reproducibility Typology**

### **GPU Non-Determinism and the Concurrency Hypothesis**

Achieving exact, bitwise reproducibility in large language model inference is exceptionally difficult.1 It is a common misconception that setting a fixed random number seed guarantees identical outputs across successive runs.18 In parallel computing environments, GPUs execute matrix multiplications and attention calculations across thousands of concurrent cores.19  
Because floating-point addition is non-associative, the order of arithmetic reduction operations alters the least significant bits of the floating-point representations 18:  
(a + b) + c is not equal to a + (b + c)  
If the execution speed of concurrent GPU threads varies due to minor hardware latency fluctuations, the reduction order changes, introducing run-to-run non-determinism.19  
However, technical analysis reveals that this "concurrency and floating-point" hypothesis is not the primary driver of non-determinism in production inference endpoints.18 Individual operations (kernels) inside the model's forward pass are run-to-run deterministic when executed in isolation.20 The primary cause of output variance is dynamic batching.18 High-performance serving engines (such as vLLM) batch concurrent requests dynamically to maximize hardware utilization.20 Because system load changes constantly, an individual request is batched with varying sets of other user prompts.20  
To optimize performance for different batch sizes, the engine dynamically selects different parallelization strategies, such as switching from a standard data-parallel matrix multiplication to a Split-K matmul, or modifying reduction trees in Split-Reduction RMSNorm.19 This batch-dependent kernel selection alters the reduction arithmetic, producing different outputs for the identical prompt.20

To enforce true bit-exact determinism, the model must be executed on an inference stack utilizing batch-invariant kernels.19 This strategy parallelizes operations entirely within individual tensor cores (data-parallel reductions) and avoids Split-K optimizations, preserving the arithmetic order regardless of batch changes.19 This exact reproducibility introduces a measurable performance tradeoff:

In empirical testing over a Qwen3-8B model, executing 1,000 runs under standard vLLM produced 80 unique completions, while forcing batch-invariant operations yielded a single, consistent completion across all runs, accompanied by a 61.5% execution latency penalty.18

#### **The Replay and Reproducibility Typology**

Because forcing bit-exact determinism across third-party cloud providers, variable GPU clusters, and dynamic databases is often impractical, systems must design for graded levels of verification 1:

| Replay Mode | Target Objective | Execution Constraints | State Preservation Requirement | System Verifications |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Exact Replay** | Recreate bitwise identical outputs for debugging.1 | Requires identical hardware, batch-invariant kernels, pinned model snapshots, and matching seeds.20 | Bit-exact saving of weights, inputs, and attention states.20 | Recomputes forward passes to verify exact token matches.20 |
| **Constrained Replay** | Recreate comparable completions on standard engines.1 | Executes on matching model versions with fixed sampling parameters and temperatures.5 | Saves the compiled prompt and exact decoding configurations.2 | Compares output tokens to ensure they fall within acceptable semantic ranges.1 |
| **Semantic Replay** | Verify that a rerun satisfies equivalent logical constraints.1 | Allows the model, prompt, or database to vary within defined boundaries.1 | Saves the evaluation rubric, task schema, and input goals.1 | Evaluates whether the new completion satisfies identical Pydantic rules and NLI grounding.1 |
| **Counterfactual Replay** | Compare how a change to a single variable alters behavior.1 | Modifies one parameter (e.g., prompt version, retrieved chunk) while keeping others constant.1 | Saves the base run as a template and isolates the variable under test.1 | Maps behavior changes to identify regressions or evaluate improvements.1 |
| **Forensic Replay** | Reconstruct the cause of a failure when re-execution is impossible.1 | Does not execute the active model; relies entirely on recorded logs and states.1 | Saves the complete execution trace, tool arguments, and environment hashes.3 | Walks the recorded sequence to pinpoint the exact failure location.3 |
| **Audit-Only** | Prove compliance with policies without exposing raw data.22 | Utilizes cryptographic hashes and signatures to verify states.1 | Saves the metadata headers, content hashes, and digital signatures.4 | Validates the signatures against root authorities to prove the run occurred as logged.15 |

### **Determinism Decay and Environment Drift**

A primary engineering challenge is that reproducibility degrades over time due to external dependencies.1 Even with fixed seeds and invariant kernels, the surrounding execution environment shifts silently, causing "determinism decay".1  
The primary operational drivers of this decay are categorized below:

* **Provider Model Updates:** Third-party API model weights are modified without changing the public model identifier, causing divergent semantic outputs.1  
* **Kernel and Library Drift:** Minor updates to deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, CUDA libraries) change internal mathematical approximations, mutating low-level floats.2  
* **Expired Caches and Rebuilt Indexes:** Changes to vector database structures or the expiration of semantic caches alter the exact retrieved context.1  
* **Time-Dependent Inputs:** System prompts injecting dynamic variables (e.g., current_time = "2026-06-11T23:19:00Z") force models into divergent logical paths.1  
* **Feature Flag Modifications:** Silent deployment updates change the active routing configurations or context limits mid-session.1

To address this, platforms must avoid false promises of bit-exact determinism, defining instead strict "reproducibility envelopes" that capture the complete state of the execution context.1

## **Verification Artifact Bundle Schema**

The central evidence container of this architecture is the **Verification Artifact Bundle**. It is a structured, schema-validated evidence object that records the minimum sufficient information required to audit, replay, or explain a consequential AI output or action.

The bundle should support JSON or CBOR serialization depending on platform tooling. It may be wrapped in an in-toto / DSSE-style envelope or another signed attestation format when the artifact class requires cryptographic proof. The important architectural rule is not the file format fetish—tempting though that altar is—but the preservation of signed, versioned, replayable evidence.

| Block Name | Example Field Paths | Capture Rule | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Identity & Scope** | `identity.request_id`, `identity.trace_id`, `identity.session_hash`, `identity.tenant_hash`, `identity.subject_hash`, `identity.workflow_id`, `identity.risk_class` | Store opaque IDs or scoped hashes by default; raw identifiers only in restricted audit stores. | Correlates the bundle with traces, sessions, tenants, subjects, workflows, and risk policy. |
| **Prompt Lineage** | `prompt.template_id`, `prompt.template_version`, `prompt.compiler_hash`, `prompt.compiled_hash`, `prompt.payload_ref`, `prompt.token_count` | Store hash and secure reference for compiled prompt; raw prompt only under access-controlled registry. | Proves which prompt template and compiled prompt shaped execution. |
| **Model / Route Manifest** | `model.requested_route`, `model.selected_route`, `model.provider`, `model.model_version_ref`, `model.decoding_settings_hash`, `model.routing_reason` | Store route/model manifest and provider-visible version; note when hosted provider cannot provide weight hash. | Documents model selection, fallback, decoding, and route changes. |
| **Retrieval Snapshot** | `retrieval.index_id`, `retrieval.index_version`, `retrieval.query_hash`, `retrieval.rewrite_hashes`, `retrieval.chunk_ids`, `retrieval.source_version_hashes`, `retrieval.evidence_refs` | Store document IDs, chunk IDs, source hashes, scores, coordinates, and secure refs; avoid raw text in general bundle. | Proves what evidence was searched, selected, omitted, cited, or unavailable. |
| **Tool Execution** | `tool.name`, `tool.schema_version`, `tool.action_class`, `tool.payload_hash`, `tool.idempotency_key_hash`, `tool.pre_state_hash`, `tool.post_state_hash`, `tool.verification_status` | Store payload hashes and redacted summaries; sensitive request/response bodies by secure reference. | Proves tool intent, arguments, authorization, side-effect status, and verification outcome. |
| **State Ledger** | `state.plan_id`, `state.step_id`, `state.transition_log`, `state.loop_count`, `state.no_progress_count`, `state.fallback_state`, `state.termination_reason` | Store state transitions and hashes; never require hidden chain-of-thought capture. | Reconstructs the workflow trajectory without exposing private reasoning. |
| **User / Reviewer Edit** | `edit.draft_hash`, `edit.final_hash`, `edit.diff_ref`, `edit.editor_hash`, `edit.edit_class`, `edit.approval_state` | Store diffs, hashes, and secure refs; redact sensitive text as required. | Shows how user or reviewer modifications changed the artifact. |
| **Output Lineage** | `output.raw_hash`, `output.post_processed_hash`, `output.policy_filtered_hash`, `output.redacted_hash`, `output.rendered_hash`, `output.final_hash` | Store transformation hashes and secure refs; raw outputs only under policy. | Tracks every transformation between model output and final displayed/submitted output. |
| **Policy Enforcement** | `policy.bundle_version`, `policy.rule_ids`, `policy.decisions`, `policy.enforcement_points`, `policy.override_state`, `policy.reviewer_hash` | Store deterministic rule results separately from classifier scores. | Proves which policy checks ran, where, and with what outcome. |
| **Human Approval** | `approval.request_id`, `approval.status`, `approval.maker_hash`, `approval.checker_hash`, `approval.payload_hash`, `approval.expires_at`, `approval.signature_ref` | Store signed approval metadata and payload hash. | Proves approval state, separation of duties, and freshness of authorization. |
| **Audit & Integrity** | `audit.bundle_hash`, `audit.parent_hash`, `audit.signature_ref`, `audit.created_at`, `audit.retention_class`, `audit.legal_hold`, `audit.redaction_class` | Sign bundle hash or envelope; store chain metadata and retention policy. | Makes the evidence record tamper-evident and governed. |

### **Risk-Class Tiering Policy**

The bundle should adapt to risk class:

| Risk Class | Capture Profile |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Low** | Metadata, hashes, route IDs, status, and short-retention trace links. |
| **Medium** | Metadata plus selected redacted snippets, secure refs, policy decisions, and tool hashes. |
| **High** | Complete-enough evidence trail with secure references, signatures, approval records, state verification, and stricter retention. |
| **Critical / Regulated** | High-risk profile plus legal hold support, stronger signing, replay package linkage, reviewer identity controls, and access-audited payload vaults. |

High risk does **not** mean “store everything raw forever.” It means preserve enough evidence to audit and replay the decision while minimizing raw sensitive payloads, enforcing access controls, and recording when data was intentionally not captured.

## **Reproducibility Envelope Model**

Every consequential AI execution should run inside a **Reproducibility Envelope**. The envelope records the system state needed to recompile, inspect, simulate, or replay the run. The reproducibility unit is not “the model” alone; it is the model route, prompt compiler, retrieval surface, policy bundle, tool contracts, feature flags, runtime configuration, and evidence state.

This envelope does not guarantee bit-exact reproduction in every environment. It defines what must be pinned, captured, or declared unknown so auditors can distinguish exact replay, constrained replay, semantic replay, counterfactual replay, forensic replay, and audit-only verification.30

## **Specialized Evidence Records**

### **The Prompt Lineage Record**

To determine whether behavior changed because of template edits, context assembly, memory inclusion, or dynamic variable injection, the system preserves a Prompt Lineage Record.

| Field Name | Physical Data Type | Capture Rule | Operational Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `prompt.template_id` | String | Metadata. | Identifies the registered template. |
| `prompt.template_version` | SemVer / release ID | Metadata. | Matches the active template registry version. |
| `prompt.template_hash` | SHA-256 hash | Hash. | Verifies template integrity without exposing text. |
| `prompt.template_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Points to raw template in controlled registry if access is allowed. |
| `prompt.compiler_version` | Version / commit SHA | Metadata. | Identifies prompt compiler behavior. |
| `prompt.context_assembler_version` | Version / commit SHA | Metadata. | Identifies context assembly logic. |
| `prompt.variable_manifest` | JSON object / hash | Redacted or secure reference. | Records which variables were injected and their capture classes. |
| `prompt.memory_refs` | Array of hashes/refs | Hash/reference. | Identifies memory items included in context. |
| `prompt.evidence_refs` | Array of chunk/source refs | Hash/reference. | Identifies retrieval chunks inserted into context. |
| `prompt.tool_schema_refs` | Array of schema hashes | Metadata/hash. | Records tool definitions available to the model. |
| `prompt.policy_refs` | Array of policy hashes | Metadata/hash. | Records dynamic safety/governance instructions. |
| `prompt.message_boundaries` | Structured offsets / roles | Metadata. | Maps system, developer, user, tool, and context scopes. |
| `prompt.compiled_hash` | SHA-256 hash | Hash. | Verifies exact compiled prompt. |
| `prompt.compiled_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Allows controlled replay of compiled prompt when permitted. |
| `prompt.token_count` | Integer | Metadata. | Records input size for cost and replay. |
| `prompt.version_diff_ref` | Secure diff reference | Restricted. | Links to template diff without dumping sensitive prompt text into logs. |

Saving only raw templates is insufficient because compiled prompts include dynamic variables, memories, retrieved evidence, tool schemas, policies, and message boundaries. The lineage record proves what was assembled without requiring every observer to see the full prompt text.

### **The Model and Route Manifest**

Model route decisions are critical audit artifacts. A silent downgrade, fallback, cache hit, provider change, or safety-route change can alter quality, cost, latency, and policy behavior.

| `route.user_disclosure_required` | Boolean | Metadata. | Records whether user should have been told. |
| `route.user_disclosure_shown` | Boolean | Metadata. | Records whether disclosure occurred. |


### **The Retrieval Evidence Snapshot**

GRC verification requires proving the context available before generation. The retrieval snapshot should show what was searched, what was authorized, what was selected, what was omitted, and how citations map to evidence.

| Field Name | Physical Data Type | Capture Rule | Description / Key Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `retrieval.raw_query_hash` | SHA-256 hash | Hash. | Verifies original query without exposing it. |
| `retrieval.raw_query_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Allows controlled access to raw query if needed. |
| `retrieval.rewrite_hashes` | Array of hashes | Hash. | Records query reformulation steps. |

| `retrieval.selected_chunk_ids` | Array | Metadata. | Logs chunks admitted into context. |
| `retrieval.omitted_chunk_ids` | Array | Metadata. | Logs relevant chunks pruned or omitted. |
| `retrieval.rerank_score_summary` | Object | Metadata. | Records score distribution or secure score references. |
| `retrieval.source_version_hashes` | Array | Hash. | Verifies parent document versions. |
| `retrieval.evidence_refs` | Array of secure refs | Restricted. | Links to raw text or regions when access is allowed. |
| `retrieval.coordinates` | Array of objects | Metadata. | Page, span, line, offset, or bounding boxes. |
| `retrieval.citation_map_hash` | SHA-256 hash | Hash. | Verifies claim-to-evidence mapping. |
| `retrieval.citation_map_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Allows detailed citation replay. |
| `retrieval.conflict_signal` | Boolean/object | Metadata. | Flags source contradiction or unresolved conflict. |

This snapshot provides bounded verifiability: it can distinguish retrieval failure, stale-source failure, citation failure, and generation failure when capture coverage, source versioning, and permission metadata are complete.

### **The Tool Execution Record**

A generated statement claiming an action succeeded is not evidence of success. Auditing requires verification of tool authorization, payload integrity, idempotency, execution status, and post-action state.

| Field Name | Physical Data Type | Capture Rule | Description / Key Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `tool.planned_name` | String | Metadata. | Tool the model/coordinator intended to invoke. |

| `tool.action_class` | Enum string | Metadata. | Examples: `read_only`, `idempotent_mutation`, `non_idempotent_mutation`, `high_impact_action`. |
| `tool.permission_decision` | Object/string | Metadata. | Records authorization outcome. |

| `tool.state_post_hash` | SHA-256 hash | Hash. | Proves source-of-record state after action, if known. |
| `tool.verification_status` | Enum string | Metadata. | Examples: `verified`, `failed`, `pending`, `unknown`, `not_applicable`. |
| `tool.compensation_supported` | Boolean | Metadata. | Records whether compensation is possible. |
| `tool.compensation_plan_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Links to compensation plan without leaking endpoint surface. |
| `tool.user_confirmation_ref` | Secure reference/hash | Restricted. | Proves required consent or approval where applicable. |

### **The Intermediate State Ledger**

To trace execution trajectories without exposing hidden reasoning or private chain-of-thought, the system preserves an Intermediate State Ledger. It records state transitions, decisions, validation failures, and observable progress—not the model’s private scratchpad.

| Field Name | Physical Data Type | Capture Rule | Description / Key Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `state.planner_version` | Version/hash | Metadata. | Tracks planner/orchestrator implementation. |
| `state.subtask_graph_hash` | SHA-256 hash | Hash. | Verifies task graph structure. |
| `state.subtask_graph_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Allows controlled inspection of task DAG. |
| `state.transitions` | Array of objects | Metadata. | Logs state-machine transitions and events. |
| `state.loop_count` | Integer | Metadata. | Tracks total loop steps against workflow profile. |
| `state.loop_budget_profile` | String | Metadata. | Links loop limit to risk/workflow class. |
| `state.memory_read_hashes` | Array of hashes | Hash. | Records memory items read. |
| `state.memory_write_hashes` | Array of hashes | Hash. | Records memory items written. |

| `state.termination_reason` | Enum string | Metadata. | Examples: `success`, `max_steps`, `budget_exhausted`, `user_cancelled`, `policy_block`, `unknown_state`. |

### **The User Edit and Output Diff Record**

The final answer displayed or submitted is the last artifact in a chain of transformations. The system should record hashes, diffs, edit metadata, and secure references while avoiding uncontrolled raw output storage.

| Field Name | Physical Data Type | Capture Rule | Description / Key Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `edit.original_draft_hash` | SHA-256 hash | Hash. | Verifies model-generated draft. |
| `edit.original_draft_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Controlled access to raw draft if retained. |

| `edit.changed_tool_args` | Boolean | Metadata. | Flags edits to tool parameters. |
| `edit.preserved_in_final` | Boolean | Metadata. | Verifies whether edit survived final rendering/submission. |

Output lineage should capture transformation hashes for each stage:

1. `output.raw_model_hash`
2. `output.post_processed_hash`
3. `output.policy_filtered_hash`
4. `output.redacted_hash`
5. `output.citation_injected_hash`
6. `output.rendered_ui_hash`
7. `output.human_edited_hash`
8. `output.final_submitted_hash`

Raw text for any stage should be stored only according to capture class and retention policy.

### **The Policy Check Record**

Policy checks must function as executable verification artifacts, not passive annotations. Deterministic rules, classifiers, human approvals, and override paths should be recorded separately so auditors can tell what kind of control actually fired.

| Field Name | Physical Data Type | Capture Rule | Description / Key Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `policy.bundle_version` | Version/hash | Metadata/hash. | Tracks active policy bundle. |

| `policy.input_hash` | SHA-256 hash | Hash. | Verifies evaluated input. |
| `policy.input_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Controlled access to evaluated content. |
| `policy.decision` | Enum string | Metadata. | Examples: `allow`, `block`, `escalate`, `redact`, `degrade`, `require_approval`. |
| `policy.rule_type` | Enum string | Metadata. | Examples: `deterministic`, `classifier`, `human_review`, `external_policy`. |

| `policy.result_status` | Enum string | Metadata. | Examples: `pass`, `fail`, `error`, `not_applicable`. |
| `policy.override_status` | Enum string | Metadata. | Examples: `none`, `requested`, `authorized`, `denied`, `expired`. |
| `policy.exception_summary` | String/object | Redacted. | Logs parser or system exception safely. |
| `policy.reviewer_hash` | SHA-256 hash | Restricted metadata. | Identifies reviewer where applicable. |
| `policy.approval_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Links to approval trail. |
| `policy.escalation_ref` | Secure reference | Restricted. | Links to escalation queue or package. |
| `policy.final_action_state` | Enum string | Metadata. | Examples: `completed`, `blocked`, `pending`, `unknown`, `review_required`. |


## **Replay Package Model and Execution Safety**

To audit, debug, or evaluate a transaction safely, the system compiles a Replay Package. A Replay Package is not merely a folder of logs; it is a controlled reconstruction environment designed to reproduce or simulate behavior without mutating production systems.

A replay package contains:

* **Trace Graph:** Parent-child spans and timing relationships.
* **Verification Bundle:** Signed evidence record for the run.
* **Reproducibility Envelope:** Prompt, model, retrieval, policy, tool, and runtime state.
* **Dependency Manifest:** Container digests, package locks, runtime versions, and feature flags.
* **Tool Mocks:** Signed, recorded responses or deterministic simulators.
* **Payload Vault References:** Secure references to redacted or raw payloads where permitted.
* **Policy Bundle:** Exact rules, thresholds, and approval requirements.
* **Evaluation Rubric:** Scoring rules for semantic or counterfactual replay.

```

These execution bounds are mapped across six replay modes:

| Replay Mode | Egress Policy | Input Constraints | Execution Layer | Target Verification | Side-Effect Prevention |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Read-Only Replay** | Egress blocked except approved artifact stores. | Inputs locked to original values. | Recompiles prompts, layouts, UI rendering, and local transformations. | Verifies rendering, formatting, redaction, and citation display. | No tool credentials; no production write paths. |
| **Mocked-Tool Replay** | Egress blocked. | Inputs locked; tool responses loaded from signed mocks. | Re-executes orchestration against recorded dependency responses. | Evaluates route behavior, state transitions, and output variance. | Tool gateway intercepts all calls and returns mocks. |
| **Sandbox Replay** | Egress restricted to isolated test network. | Inputs locked or copied into sandbox fixtures. | Runs against test database, test tool servers, and inert credentials. | Evaluates integration behavior under controlled conditions. | Production endpoints denied; credentials scoped to sandbox only. |
| **Counterfactual Replay** | Egress blocked or sandbox-only. | Allows one declared variable modification at a time. | Re-runs selected prompt/model/retrieval/policy variant. | Attributes behavioral changes to the modified variable. | Tools mocked unless explicit sandbox mutation is approved. |
| **Semantic Replay** | Egress blocked or sandbox-only. | Inputs locked; model may vary within declared route envelope. | Evaluates logical constraints, grounding, citations, and policy outcomes. | Verifies equivalent behavior rather than exact tokens. | No production side effects; unknown states remain marked unknown. |
| **Forensic Replay** | No execution egress. | No active model/tool execution. | Timeline analysis of recorded evidence. | Identifies likely failure point from trace, ledger, and artifacts. | Complete decoupling from execution systems. |


## **Evidence Chain and Tamper-Evidence Infrastructure**

To detect silent modification or deletion of verification artifacts, the platform should implement tamper-evident evidence chains. Each Verification Artifact Bundle is canonicalized, hashed, signed when required, and linked to prior artifacts or workflow checkpoints.

The hash-chain relation can be expressed as:

h_i = H(canonical(bundle_i) || h_(i-1))

where `H` is a collision-resistant hash function, `canonical(bundle_i)` is a deterministic serialization of the bundle, and `h_(i-1)` is the previous chain hash. This does not make evidence indestructible or magically true. It makes later alteration detectable when verification is performed.

The platform may use several signing and provenance mechanisms depending on artifact type:

1. **Signed Attestation Envelope:** Verification bundles, model manifests, tool manifests, and replay packages can be wrapped in DSSE / in-toto-style signed envelopes.
2. **Sigstore / Fulcio / Rekor:** CI/CD artifacts, container images, model bundles, and build outputs can use keyless signing and transparency logging where appropriate.
3. **C2PA Manifests:** Images, charts, video, generated media, or datasets may carry embedded or sidecar C2PA manifests. Text-only or binary artifacts may bind to C2PA through sidecar manifests and asset references.
4. **Internal WORM / Append-Only Ledger:** Regulated systems may store chain checkpoints in WORM object storage or append-only audit databases.
5. **External Anchoring:** High-assurance systems may periodically anchor evidence-chain checkpoints externally to improve tamper detection.

```

If a historical record is altered, hash-chain verification fails and the system can trigger investigation, containment, and recovery workflows. That is the sober version. The cartoon version where cryptography tackles the attacker through a window is, regrettably, not in scope.


## **Artifact Privacy, Redaction, and Retention Model**

Verification artifacts contain sensitive operational data: proprietary documents, customer records, payment details, credentials, policy decisions, reviewer comments, tool payloads, and source-of-record state. Evidence trails must therefore follow a data-minimization model. Auditability is not permission to build a beautifully indexed breach warehouse.

Redaction should be layered. Regex and NER scans are useful but insufficient alone. The system should combine structured field suppression, secret scanning, policy-aware capture classes, secure payload references, access logging, retention limits, and legal-hold rules.

```

| Capture Class | Technical Processing Rule | Physical Storage Substrate | Access Control Level | Typical Data Target |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0. Never Capture** | Strip or block before any persistent write. | No raw storage. | None for raw value; security event may record detection metadata. | Passwords, API tokens, private keys, CVVs, raw auth headers. |
| **1. Hash Only** | Store digest and capture metadata; discard raw payload. | Metadata database or audit ledger. | Restricted audit/SRE as policy allows. | Large payload identity, file equality checks, prompt/output fingerprints. |
| **2. Metadata Only** | Store size, schema, type, source ID, status, version, and timing. | Trace store or artifact metadata index. | Standard operational access if non-sensitive. | Parser status, route metadata, model IDs, schema names. |
| **3. Redacted Snippet** | Store minimal masked excerpt sufficient for debugging. | Secure artifact store with retention limit. | Purpose-bound operator/auditor access. | Conversation excerpts, validation errors, reviewer notes. |
| **4. Reference Only** | Store raw payload in secure vault; artifact stores only hash and reference. | Encrypted object store or payload vault. | Role-gated and access-logged. | Customer PDFs, full prompts, tool request/response bodies, raw completions. |
| **5. Restricted Full Payload** | Retain full payload only when legally or operationally required. | Segregated encrypted vault or WORM storage. | Strict audit/security/legal roles; all access logged. | Regulated evidence, high-impact transaction records, legal holds. |
| **6. Incident Mode** | Temporarily escalate capture under declared incident policy. | Forensic vault with short TTL or legal hold. | Incident/security team with approval trail. | Active attack traces, compromised tool sessions, outage forensics. |

Metadata can itself be sensitive. Tenant hashes, source IDs, route choices, policy decisions, and timing records can reveal business activity. Access rules should therefore apply to both payloads and metadata.


## **GRC Audit Query Playbook**

To support audits, investigations, dispute resolution, and regulatory inspections, the verification framework should map common audit questions to the artifacts and replay modes required to answer them.

| Audit Question | Required Verification Artifacts | Target Trace Fields / Metadata | Optimal Replay Mode | Technical Validation Path |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Why did the model cite this source?** | Retrieval Snapshot, Output Lineage, Model/Route Manifest. | `retrieval.selected_chunk_ids`, `retrieval.citation_map_ref`, `output.citation_injected_hash`. | Forensic Replay. | Verify claim-to-source mapping, source version, and evidence support. |

| **Which tool call failed, and did it succeed later?** | Tool Execution Record, State Ledger. | `tool.error_status`, `tool.verification_status`, `state.transitions`. | Forensic Replay. | Walk action ledger and post-action verification state. |
| **Did the tool actually execute, or did the model hallucinate success?** | Tool Execution Record, Output Lineage. | `tool.state_post_hash`, `tool.verification_status`, `output.final_hash`. | Forensic Replay. | Verify source-of-record state and compare completion claim to verified state. |
| **Was confirmation shown before transaction execution?** | Tool Execution Record, Policy Check Record, Human Approval Record. | `tool.user_confirmation_ref`, `policy.decision`, `approval.status`. | Forensic Replay. | Confirm approval/consent existed before high-impact action boundary. |

## **Artifact Lifecycle and Storage Architecture**

Verification artifacts must be retained according to risk, regulatory obligations, incident status, tenant contract, and operational debugging value. Storage architecture should therefore be policy-based rather than hardcoded to one fixed age ladder. A low-risk FAQ trace, a failed high-impact payment action, a legal hold, and an active security incident should not share the same retention path just because the calendar was feeling democratic.

```

The operational profiles, retrieval expectations, and redundancy targets of these storage tiers are specified below:

| Storage Tier | Retention Window | Retrieval Expectation | Storage Pattern | Encryption and Access | Typical Contents |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Hot Operational** | Short operational window defined by retention class. | Fast enough for debugging and incident triage. | Operational database, trace store, short-TTL object store, or managed equivalent. | Tenant-scoped encryption, role-based access, audit logs. | Metadata, hashes, redacted snippets, recent traces, pending action state. |
| **Warm Audit** | Medium retention window defined by audit and product policy. | Hours to day-scale retrieval depending on policy. | Content-addressed object storage, signed bundle registry, audit index. | Strong access control, access logging, scoped evidence views. | Verification bundles, manifests, secure payload references, signed hashes, reviewer artifacts. |
| **Cold Compliance** | Long retention window for regulated, contractual, or legal-hold artifacts. | Slower retrieval acceptable. | WORM storage, immutable archive, Glacier-like storage, or compliant managed archive. | Legal/compliance access controls, key management, deletion controls. | Signed evidence chains, legal-hold bundles, high-impact action records, compliance artifacts. |
| **Forensic Vault** | Incident-scoped retention window or legal-hold period. | Fast during incident, policy-controlled afterward. | Segregated forensic storage with restricted access and enhanced logging. | Security/legal approval, immutable access logs, strict retention review. | Attack traces, compromised sessions, break-glass records, raw payloads when justified. |
| **Hash-Only Archive** | Long-lived integrity reference. | Lightweight lookup. | Metadata ledger or content-addressed hash registry. | Lower exposure than payload stores but still access controlled. | Content hashes, chain hashes, artifact IDs, deletion tombstones, proof-of-existence records. |

Evidence indexes should be searchable through authorized metadata views across keys such as `trace_id`, `artifact_id`, `workflow_id`, `prompt_version`, `model_route`, `document_id`, `tool_call_id`, `approval_request_id`, and `final_output_hash`. Raw `tenant_id`, `session_id`, and user identifiers should be avoided in broad indexes; use scoped hashes or access-controlled identity joins.

Storage policy must also support:

| Lifecycle Control | Requirement |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Legal Hold** | Suspends deletion and records authority, scope, and reason. |
| **Deletion Eligibility** | Determines when payloads, metadata, hashes, or references may be purged. |
| **Payload Minimization** | Allows raw payload deletion while preserving hash-bound proof where legally permitted. |
| **Access Logging** | Records every access to sensitive payload references and restricted bundles. |
| **Key Management** | Supports tenant-scoped keys, rotation, revocation, and recovery procedures. |
| **Redaction Reprocessing** | Allows artifacts to be reclassified or re-redacted when policy changes. |
| **Integrity Verification** | Periodically verifies hash chains, signatures, manifests, and storage references. |

## **Cross-Canon Handoff Map**

The Verification Artifacts architecture integrates across the entire AI Systems Engineering Canon because every major subsystem eventually needs evidence for audit, replay, incident response, evaluation, governance, and dispute resolution.

| Target Report ID | Target Report Domain | Verification Artifact Handoff | Dependency / Engineering Integration Rules |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **AI-ENG-B** | Context and State Governance | Context snapshots, memory refs, state hashes, compaction records. | Preserve enough context lineage to prove what was available, included, omitted, or summarized. |
| **AI-ENG-D** | Corpus Engineering | Source provenance, corpus manifests, document version hashes, ingestion records. | Evidence artifacts must bind claims to source lineage and corpus version. |
| **AI-ENG-E** | Retrieval Pipeline | Retrieval snapshots, query hashes, source refs, citation maps, permission filters. | Retrieval evidence must prove authorization, source version, selected chunks, omitted chunks, and citation bindings. |
| **AI-ENG-F** | Freshness and Conflict Detection | Freshness flags, conflict signals, source-age metadata, stale-cache records. | Audit trails must show whether outputs relied on stale, conflicting, or unresolved evidence. |
| **AI-ENG-G** | Model Selection | Model/route manifest, requested route, selected route, fallback reason. | Silent downgrades, provider shifts, and capability changes must be replayable. |
| **AI-ENG-H** | Model Adaptation | Adapter hashes, fine-tune manifests, calibration artifacts, regression records. | Adapted model behavior must be traceable to training/adaptation lineage. |
| **AI-ENG-I** | Regression Control | Baseline artifacts, failed-run bundles, diff records, gate outcomes. | Regression investigations require preserved inputs, outputs, routes, and evaluation artifacts. |
| **AI-ENG-J** | Throughput Mechanics | Token metrics, latency spans, serving-envelope data, queue and batch policy. | Performance regressions must be tied to reproducibility envelopes and serving conditions. |
| **AI-ENG-K** | Weight Dynamics | Quantization/compression manifests, runtime kernel settings, model snapshots. | Optimization-induced behavior changes require route and model-state evidence. |
| **AI-ENG-L** | Serving Architecture | Provider manifest, route manifest, cache state, fallback path, deployment hash. | Serving decisions must be reconstructable from route and environment artifacts. |
| **AI-ENG-M** | Agentic Orchestration | State ledger, plan graph refs, loop counters, branch/retry records. | Agent failures require trajectory evidence without exposing hidden reasoning. |
| **AI-ENG-N** | Tool Contracts | Tool schema versions, payload hashes, authorization records, idempotency hashes. | Tool calls must be auditable from planned call through verified post-action state. |
| **AI-ENG-O** | Action Verification | Pre/post state hashes, action ledger, verification status, compensation refs. | Completion claims require state-backed verification artifacts. |
| **AI-ENG-P** | Multimodal Understanding | Parser manifests, OCR/layout refs, coordinates, media hashes, evidence regions. | Visual/document claims must bind to source coordinates or secure evidence refs. |
| **AI-ENG-Q** | Speech and Realtime Interaction | Transcript hashes, confirmation records, voice fallback state, endpointing metadata. | High-impact voice actions need replayable confirmation and transcript evidence. |
| **AI-ENG-R** | UI Agents | UI state snapshots, DOM/screenshot hashes, action refs, post-action verification. | UI automation must preserve observe-act-verify evidence. |
| **AI-ENG-S** | Production Pathologies | Malformed output records, repair-loop artifacts, false-success traces. | Pathologies require typed evidence for debugging and regression tests. |
| **AI-ENG-T** | Boundary Defense | Tenant hashes, authorization decisions, prompt-injection evidence, redaction records. | Security boundaries must be provable without leaking the protected payload. |
| **AI-ENG-U** | Supply Chain Security | Signed manifests, dependency locks, parser/tool/container hashes. | Evidence trails must bind behavior to approved supply-chain artifacts. |
| **AI-ENG-V** | Resource Abuse | Cost ledgers, token-burn records, retry artifacts, quota state. | Cost bombs and runaway loops need replayable consumption evidence. |
| **AI-ENG-W** | UX Resilience | Degraded-mode state, fallback disclosures, partial-answer records, saved-state refs. | User-visible degraded states must be backed by evidence of preserved state and disclosure. |
| **AI-ENG-X** | User Trust and Transparency | Disclosure records, citation UX state, contestability records, user correction diffs. | Trust claims must be tied to what the user actually saw and could contest. |
| **AI-ENG-Y** | High-Impact Workflow Design | Approval packets, maker/checker records, escalation packages, break-glass artifacts. | High-impact decisions require signed approval, reviewer, and escalation evidence. |
| **AI-ENG-Z** | Strategic Telemetry | Trace IDs, span IDs, token metrics, latency records, semantic drift signals. | Telemetry provides sensor data; verification artifacts preserve durable evidence. |
| **AI-ENG-AA** | Evals Architecture | Golden traces, case versions, labels, rubrics, regression gate artifacts. | Production failures and corrected outputs should become reproducible evaluation artifacts where appropriate. |
| **AI-ENG-AC** | Incident Response and Remediation | Forensic bundles, containment timeline, compromised artifact refs, recovery evidence. | Incidents require evidence chains for scope, timeline, root cause, and remediation. |
| **AI-ENG-AD** | Governance and Compliance | Retention class, policy bundle, approval authority, audit signatures, access logs. | Governance defines capture obligations, retention, deletion, legal hold, and exception approvals. |
| **AI-ENG-AJ** | Reference Architectures | Verification bundle schema, replay package pattern, evidence store, audit ledger. | Reference architectures should include evidence trails as first-class infrastructure. |

## **Durable Principles of Verification Artifacts**

1. **Logs Are Not Evidence Trails**  
   Logs show that something happened somewhere. Verification artifacts preserve enough structured evidence to reconstruct what happened, why it happened, what data shaped it, and what state resulted.

2. **Auditability Requires Scope, Not Hoarding**  
   More raw data is not automatically better auditability. Better auditability comes from scoped hashes, secure references, source versions, policy decisions, state checks, and signed manifests.

3. **Tamper-Evident Does Not Mean True**  
   A signed artifact proves integrity of the recorded evidence. It does not prove the underlying decision was correct unless the evidence, checks, and policies were also adequate.

4. **Replay Has Levels**  
   Exact replay, constrained replay, semantic replay, counterfactual replay, forensic replay, and audit-only verification serve different purposes. Do not promise bit-exact reproduction when the environment cannot support it.

5. **The Reproducibility Unit Is the Whole Runtime**  
   Model ID alone is not enough. Prompt compiler, retrieval index, policy bundle, route manifest, tool schema, feature flags, cache state, and deployment environment all shape behavior.

6. **Hidden Reasoning Is Not an Audit Primitive**  
   Preserve decisions, state transitions, prompts, evidence, policy checks, tool calls, and outputs. Do not require private chain-of-thought capture to explain system behavior.

7. **Tool Claims Require State Evidence**  
   “The model said it sent the invoice” proves nothing. Tool records must preserve authorization, payload hash, idempotency, execution status, and post-action verification.

8. **Sensitive Payloads Need Capture Classes**  
   Never-capture, hash-only, metadata-only, redacted snippet, reference-only, restricted full payload, and incident-mode capture should be explicit policy states.

9. **Evidence Storage Must Follow Risk and Law**  
   Retention windows should be driven by risk class, contract, regulation, incident state, legal hold, and operational need—not by vibes or one universal timer.

10. **Every Artifact Needs Ownership**  
   Prompt records, route manifests, retrieval snapshots, policy checks, approval records, and replay packages need owners, version history, and access rules.

11. **Evidence Must Support Dispute Resolution**  
   A user correction, reviewer override, citation dispute, model downgrade, or failed action should be traceable through artifacts rather than reconstructed from memory and regret.

12. **Verification Infrastructure Is Governance Infrastructure**  
   If the system cannot prove what happened, it cannot be governed. If it cannot be governed, it should not be trusted with consequential autonomy.
