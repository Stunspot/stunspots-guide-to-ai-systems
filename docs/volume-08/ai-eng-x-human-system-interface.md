# AI-ENG-X — Human-System Interface: Trust Calibration, Provenance & Control

## **Doctrinal Foundations: Interface as Reliance Calibration Infrastructure**

The structural integrity of a high-dimensional artificial intelligence system depends on a fundamental law of human-computer interaction: the human-system interface is not a decorative frame around model output, but rather operational control infrastructure designed to regulate user reliance.1 In legacy software engineering, user interfaces operate under deterministic assumptions where system outputs are strictly mapped to transactional backend states. Under this paradigm, the primary design objective is to eliminate user-perceived friction and maximize trust in the system's execution. In modern architectures driven by probabilistic large language models (LLMs), however, backend availability does not guarantee a successful, safe, or contextually coherent transaction.3 An artificial intelligence system can generate a linguistically fluent, highly prescriptive, and structurally valid output that contains catastrophic factual confabulations, unauthorized tool executions, or subtle policy violations.4 Consequently, interfaces designed strictly to maximize trust become amplification engines for automation bias, leading users to uncritically accept erroneous outputs, ignore missing evidence, or delegate irreversible actions without verification.1  
To address this systemic vulnerability, high-dimensional architectures must implement a dedicated trust-calibration layer.1 Trust calibration is the systematic alignment of a user’s subjective trust and behavioral reliance with the actual, dynamic capabilities of the automated system.7 The central objective is neither the cultivation of uncritical acceptance nor the entrenchment of permanent skepticism; it is the establishment of calibrated reliance, wherein the user relies on the automation when it is competent and intervenes or overrides when it is not.8 Achieving this balance requires transforming the interface into a legible, real-time representation of system capabilities, limitations, uncertainty, and provenance.1

## **The Trust Calibration Model**

The human decision to rely on, verify, edit, approve, undo, or escalate an AI system's output is governed by a dynamic cognitive process that unfolds across repeated interactions.1 Traditional interface designs treat trust as an additive metric, assuming that increasing user trust globally will improve human-AI collaboration.32 Human factors research proves that this assumption is fundamentally flawed: excessive trust leads to catastrophic errors of commission, while insufficient trust results in algorithm aversion, where users discard valuable automation to perform tasks manually at a significantly higher operational cost.5  
To engineer a balanced interaction, the system must deploy a formal Trust Calibration Model.1 Trust is shaped by a multi-dimensional matrix of variables, including user characteristics (such as domain expertise and baseline propensity to trust), AI system attributes (such as accuracy, transparency, and consistency), and contextual constraints (such as task risk and time pressure).32 The correspondence between actual system capability and subjective user trust is measured across two distinct dimensions: resolution and specificity.7 Trust resolution is the precision with which a user's trust distinguishes between different levels of system capability.7 Trust specificity is the degree to which trust is associated with a particular functional component (functional specificity) or a specific situational context (temporal specificity).7  
The relationship between user utility, system latency, and inference cost can be modeled as a Stackelberg game.3 Let U_a represent the user utility derived from model action a, t_a represent the latency delay associated with that action, and c_a represent the monetary cost of the inference execution to the provider.3 The user's action selection seeks to maximize their utility minus the latency penalty, moderated by a sensitivity parameter beta 3:  
max_{a in A} (U_a - beta * t_a)  
In this game, the system provider acting as the leader optimizes its routing policies and interface disclosures to minimize operational service costs (sum of c_i) while maintaining user retention.3 If the interface fails to communicate degradation, the user's utility collapses as they over-rely on a downgraded system.3 Calibrating trust requires the system to dynamically expose its capabilities and limitations, transferring the decision-making agency back to the user.3  
The active trust calibration model operates continuously throughout the interaction lifecycle, updating the user's mental model with every transactional outcome.1

```

To prevent overtrust, the interface must actively enforce structural constraints and cognitive friction. This is achieved by limiting the volume of unverified evidence displayed, raising explicit notifications when model outputs deviate from retrieved documents, inserting approval gates on actions with high financial or legal reversibility, and dynamically measuring source freshness.4 Conversely, preventing undertrust requires the interface to render transparent verification ledgers, provide direct, deep-linked access to original source files with highlighted segments, maintain user-facing corrections across sessions, and establish explicit audit trails that prove successful background tool executions.4 This bidirectional regulation transforms the interface from a passive display into an active trust calibration engine.1

## **The Uncertainty Display Ladder**

A system that presents all outputs with uniform graphical polish and stylistic certainty creates a false sense of security, encouraging uncritical user acceptance.14 To prevent this, architectures must implement an Uncertainty Display Ladder.14 Uncertainty must be visualized and communicated precisely at the moment it affects user judgment, avoiding constant alarm noise that causes warning blindness and alert fatigue.4  
The Uncertainty Display Ladder maps ten distinct classes of system uncertainty to specific, graded visual and behavioral thresholds inside the user interface, incorporating research findings that 58% of users show increased trust when uncertainty is clearly visualized.14

| Ladder Level | Target Uncertainty Class | Interface Display Trigger | Core UI/UX Pattern | Expected User Action | Fallback & Fail-Closed Rules |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Level 1: No Display** | Deterministic Verification 4 | Character exact matching; database transactional validation matches plan.4 | Sharp, solid borders; high-contrast saturated text layouts; standard interface controls.14 | Direct interaction; user executes follow-up steps without friction.14 | None; the system remains in the high-speed default execution state.3 |
| **Level 2: Subtle Cue** | Factual / Model-Weight Probability 4 | Log-likelihood token entropy crosses lower threshold (H(X) > 0.35). | Light dotted gray underline; hover tooltip showing local confidence percentage.14 | Casual inspection; user hovers to view confidence before copying text.14 | If the user copies unverified text, append a warning label to the clipboard payload. |
| **Level 3: Inline Caveat** | Extraction / Retrieval Failure 4 | Snappy propagated relevance score drops below baseline; OCR confidence < 0.85.10 | Dull, muted color tones; sketchy, hand-drawn vector borders over ungrounded blocks.14 | Active verification; user clicks inline citation badge to view source document layout.10 | Switch context to a basic text preview and disable advanced rich text formatting.3 |
| **Level 4: Approval Gate** | Action / Tool-State Uncertainty 4 | Model attempts to execute non-idempotent tool over ambiguous parameters.3 | Orange border highlights; modal window displaying complete parameter diffs and costs.3 | Explicit confirmation; user must slide or click a dual-control confirmation gate.4 | Halt execution; save populated arguments to the session state; flag for manual review.3 |
| **Level 5: Fail-Closed** | Security / Permission / Quota Breach 4 | Robust z-score hubness check flags indexing poison; tenant ID mismatch.4 | Full-screen red error overlay; unclickable, locked controls; explicit failure disclosure.3 | Complete cessation; user escalates to platform administrator.3 | Revoke all temporary session credentials, flush local caches, and close WebSocket threads.3 |

```
[Level 5: Fail-Closed] ─── (Uncertainty > Threshold) ───> System Blocks Action & Logs Trace   
         ▲  
[Level 4: Approval Gate] ─── (Uncertainty + Action Risk) ───> Multi-Factor Gesture Gate   
         ▲  
[Level 3: Inline Caveat] ─── (Extraction / Retrieval Fail) ───> Sketchy Outlines & Dull Tones   
         ▲  
 ─── (Probabilistic Logits Entropy) ───> Dotted Underlines & Tooltips   
         ▲  
 ─── (Deterministic Verification) ───> Sharp Borders & Standard Saturation 
```

Implementing this ladder requires the interface controller to dynamically intercept the model's generation stream, evaluating the metadata context before tokens are rendered on the viewport.4 For example, when processing a complex document containing low-contrast text scans (extraction uncertainty), the layout parser raises an ocr_low_confidence event, which automatically demotes the rendering engine from Level 1 to Level 3, turning the text container’s styling to a muted gray and overlaying a sketchy outline to communicate the underlying structural fragility.10 If the model then attempts to send an email based on this unverified extraction (action-state uncertainty), the system triggers a Level 4 gate, freezing the execution thread until the user completes a slide-to-confirm gesture.4

## **The Confidence Signaling Model**

A key failure mode in human-AI collaboration is the over-precision of confidence scores, where displaying raw percentages (such as "92% confident") creates a false sense of objective certainty.14 In high-dimensional architectures, confidence is not a single, unified variable; a system may be highly confident in its linguistic generation while possessing zero grounding in retrieved documents or tool outputs.4 Furthermore, raw probabilistic scores are often uncalibrated, representing model self-assurance rather than historical accuracy.1  
To build a reliable signaling architecture, developers must isolate and display different confidence dimensions independently, pairing each signal with actionable, decision-centric guidance.1

To eliminate the cognitive load of raw percentages, these multidimensional confidence metrics are mapped to qualitative, action-oriented categories integrated directly within the user workflow.14

| Confidence Dimension | Underlying Metric Source | Target Thresholds | Optimal UI Presentation | Action-Guidance Labeling | Cognitive Bias Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Answer Correctness** | Model-weight log-probability of generated text tokens.4 | High: >= 0.95 Medium: 0.70 - 0.94 Low: < 0.70.16 | Muted gray text for low; standard black for high. Hedges "likely" or "probably".2 | "Verify sources before applying" or "Safe to proceed with edits".14 | **Automation Bias:** Highly fluent text overrides low correctness signals.5 |
| **Source Support** | Natural Language Inference (NLI) entailment score of claim against chunk.4 | High: >= 0.92 Medium: 0.75 - 0.91 Low: < 0.75.4 | Collapsible green (high) or yellow (medium) citation badges inline.14 | "Claim directly supported" or "Partial support; check context".4 | **Citation Theater:** Mere presence of citation badge implies support.4 |
| **Extraction Quality** | Character-level OCR confidence; layout parsing node consistency.10 | High: >= 0.98 Medium: 0.85 - 0.97 Low: < 0.85.10 | Rendered image bounding box colored green, orange, or red.10 | "High quality scan" or "Poor resolution; characters may drift".4 | **Over-Precision Bias:** User trusts extracted numbers blindly due to grid display.14 |
| **Tool Execution** | API response code matches; JSON-schema validator matches plan.4 | Success: 1.00 Pending: 0.50 Failed: 0.00.4 | Live step checkbox timeline; rotating progress circle.3 | "Transaction settled" or "API timeout; checking ledger".3 | **Complacency Bias:** User assumes backend writes succeeded when API times out.4 |
| **Model Routing** | Router cost-to-capability distance score; window headroom.3 | Optimal: >= 0.90 Fallback: < 0.90.3 | "Efficient Mode" banner vs "Deliberative Mode" badge.3 | "Running in efficient mode; complex citations disabled".3 | **Algorithm Aversion:** User rejects fallback model due to subtle phrasing shifts.3 |

This granular mapping prevents the thundering herd of raw numbers from overwhelming the operator while ensuring that critical, dimension-specific failures (such as a high-correctness answer built on zero source support) are made immediately legible.14

## **The Citation UX Framework**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) reduces model-level hallucinations by anchoring generations in external knowledge bases.48 However, presenting citations merely as static, decorative footnotes is a failure of interface design; doing so hides critical details, encourages citation theater, and prevents rapid human auditing.4 To serve as effective reliance-calibration controls, citations must function as interactive visual bindings that connect generated text claims directly to verified visual, spatial, or structural source coordinates inside the reference documents.10  
During document ingestion, the system must maintain an unbroken coordinate chain from the original raw file coordinates to the serialized markdown chunks and generated tokens.10 Spatially-grounded region retrieval propagates late-interaction patch similarity scores (S_MaxSim) directly to OCR-extracted bounding boxes (B) using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) spatial weighting 10:  
score_region(B) = sum_{j in P} IoU(P_j, B) * score_patch(j)  
This formulation enables the interface to pinpoint the exact visual coordinates of supporting evidence.10 Research evaluating source presentation formats shows that high-visibility interfaces, such as *aligned sidebars* and *on-demand hover cards*, generate significantly more user interaction and support better verification than collapsible lists or simple footers.44

Implementing this aligned, split-screen interaction requires defining specific UI control behaviors across different evidence modalities.10

| Evidence Modality | Target Coordinates Standard | Primary UI Presentation | Hover & Focus Interactions | Action Controls & Verification | Fallback & Degraded Patterns |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Structured PDF Text** | Page number + Normalized Bounding Box: [x1, y1, x2, y2].10 | Inline green bracketed citation badge; split-screen PDF preview panel.10 | Highlights the matching sentence on the rendered document page image.10 | "Open Source Document" button; "Flag Citation Mismatch" link.4 | Converts coordinates to standard text snippets if the visual PDF panel fails to render.3 |
| **Tabular Data Grid** | Parent Table ID + Target Cell Row/Col index + Box.10 | Highlighted orange grid mark; side-by-side reconstruction of the table cells.10 | Highlights the row and column headers on hover to preserve cell context.10 | "Export Table to CSV" button; "View Original Image Source" control.10 | Falls back to displaying raw markdown table strings with warning banner.3 |
| **Visual Chart / Plot** | Plot Image Region + Axis Scale mappings + Series label.10 | Linearized data table; visual axis bounding outline on original plot image.10 | Tooltip displaying pixel-to-value calculated coordinate variables.10 | "Recompute Axis Calculation" button; "Audit DePlot Translation".4 | Displays a list of verified data points with scale warning disclaimer.4 |
| **Image Region Crop** | Page Region normalized bounding coordinates.10 | Framed image crop box embedded inside the chat bubble text flow.10 | Scales the bounding box region by 10% on hover to reveal surrounding context.10 | "Upscale Bounding Box Resolution" link; "Run Direct OCR scan".4 | Hides visual crop entirely; presents extracted textual caption only.3 |
| **Temporal Video Frame** | Timestamp range: [t_start, t_end] + Target frame index.10 | Interactive keyframe filmstrip card showing chronological segment transitions.10 | Hovering over card scrubs video playback head to starting timestamp.10 | "Play Video Segment" button; "View Segment Subtitle Transcript".10 | Displays static, diverse global keyframes (Beginning-Middle-End) with timestamp list.3 |

Furthermore, the interface must deploy specific UX patterns to handle anomalous or degraded retrieval states without generating hallucinations or silent failures.3

* **Conflicting Sources**: When retrieved chunks present contradictory facts (e.g., Document A states "12% margin" while Document B states "14%"), the interface must render a split-screen comparative card with a yellow conflict indicator, forcing the user to manually select which document's authority governs the active transaction.3  
* **Stale Sources**: If retrieved chunks exceed their configured time-to-live thresholds, the citation badge must be styled with a gray clock icon and a freshness label showing the last-modified date, prompting the user to click a "Re-fetch Live Data" action button before proceeding.3  
* **Partial Retrieval**: If a multi-page continuation table is cut off by the retrieval pipeline, the interface must flag the boundary with a dotted baseline indicator and present a "Retrieve Surrounding Context" control to expand the document bounding box dynamically by 10%.4  
* **Inaccessible/Missing Sources**: If a document is deleted from S3 but remains in the vector index cache, the system must render a grayed-out citation placeholder with a "Source Inaccessible" caveat, blocking downstream tool actions that rely on the file’s verified presence.3  
* **Degraded-Mode Citations**: Under active model downgrades or API throttling, the system falls back to displaying simple document file names and plain-text paragraph snippets, disabling expensive real-time visual coordinate rendering to conserve network bandwidth.3

## **The Provenance Display Model**

Provenance establishes the chain of custody of digital assets, tracking where content came from, what tools transformed it, and what modifications were applied.19 Displaying provenance requires strict adherence to the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and Adobe Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) specifications.20 The primary goal of a provenance display is to expose cryptographic evidence without suggesting absolute truth; a valid signature proves the manifest's integrity and its association with a verified legal identity, not the objective truth of its content.19  
A C2PA Manifest consists of three required components 20:

1. **Assertions**: Individual statements of fact, such as the creation tool, author identity, and editing actions.21  
2. **Claim**: A serialized block containing CBOR-encoded hashes of all assertions and a hard binding hash of the asset's binary content.52  
3. **Claim Signature**: A COSE_Sign1 digital signature over the claim using an X.509 certificate issued by a trusted Certification Authority on the C2PA Trust List.21

To display these parameters on the user interface, the system maps the verified JUMBF container structures directly to a standard, non-deceptive Provenance Display Matrix.20

| Provenance Class | Core Data Manifest Attributes | Primary UI Presentation Pattern | Trust Verification Signal | Deceptive Attack Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Source Document Ingest** | c2pa.hash.data matching the S3 storage file hash; signed ingestion manifest.53 | Ingestion Badge: "Cryptographically Verified Source Document".4 | Certificate matches corporate Key Management Service (KMS) root.4 | **Provenance Theater:** Static checkmark icon without active hash checks.4 |
| **RAG Retrieval Path** | c2pa.ingredient containing parent chunk hashes; pgvector transaction ID.52 | Timeline visualization showing the path of chunks from S3 to active context.4 | Checksum verification of vector coordinates against the secure retrieval registry.4 | **Index Poisoning:** Adversarial hubness manipulates ranking; injects fake manifest.4 |
| **Model Generation** | c2pa.actions.v2 with digitalSourceType set to trainedAlgorithmicMedia.54 | Inline Shield Badge: "AI Generated" with link to model provider certificate.50 | Sigstore public transparency log (Rekor) Merkle inclusion proof.4 | **Signature Spoofing:** Attacker signs malicious text using a self-signed cert.4 |
| **Human-Edited Output** | c2pa.actions with action string set to c2pa.edited; parentOf links.54 | Chronological edit history stack; green (added) and red (removed) character diff view.33 | Cryptographic hash links parent manifest to the active edited manifest.53 | **History Stripping:** Non-C2PA aware editors strip intermediate manifests.19 |
| **Cached Answer** | c2pa.hash.data matching the Redis cache key hash; owner signature check.3 | Freshness Badge: "Showing cached response from [timestamp]".3 | Hashed tenant scope credentials match active session JWT.3 | **Timing Side-Channel:** Guessing tokens leaks cached data prefixes.4 |
| **Voice Streaming** | Spectral PerTH watermark payload; signed dynamic WebRTC stream hash.10 | Liveness Shield: "Verified Dynamic Voice Connection".10 | Real-time anti-spoofing classifier returns Mamba-SSM score > 0.98.10 | **Acoustic Spoofing:** AI-generated deepfake clone bypasses biometrics.10 |

This matrix enforces the absolute rule that no verification badge can render on screen unless the underlying client has recursively verified the signature and byte-level hashes of the asset.21

## **The Explanation Design Model**

Explanations are crucial tools for trust calibration, but poorly designed explanations can actually increase overreliance.7 If an AI system generates a detailed, authoritative narrative justifying an incorrect prediction, users interpret the explanation as a general signal of competence and defer to the machine without verifying its content.7  
The Explanation Design Model must be built around support for critical human decision-making rather than model vanity.7 The system should prioritize inspectable evidence, structural constraints, and comparative reasoning over fluent, post-hoc reasoning narratives.22 Interaction designs must leverage dual-process theories of cognition, employing cognitive forcing functions to disrupt fast, intuitive System 1 heuristics and compel analytical, deliberate System 2 reasoning.59

| Explanation Class | Core Objective | Primary Structural Mechanism | Visual / Modality Presentation | Optimal Interface Location | Cognitive Forcing Functions (CFF) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Evidence Explanation** | Connect claims to inspectable proof.23 | High-resolution PDF coordinate highlight.10 | Split-screen document viewer with highlighted regions.10 | Adjacent sidebar panel.44 | **Highlighting CFF:** Force the user to hover over 3 highlighted regions before copy-pasting.62 |
| **Process Explanation** | Show the steps proposed to complete a task.37 | Structured JSON execution plan checklist.37 | Vertical flowchart diagram with step status indicators.45 | Persistent top-of-page canvas panel.46 | **Assumptions CFF:** Require the user to evaluate and approve 2 implicit assumptions behind the plan.37 |
| **Constraint Explanation** | Explain why an action was blocked.4 | Business policy schema matrix intersection.3 | Muted warning block with bold inline rule text.14 | Directly overlaying the disabled control button.3 | **Justification CFF:** Force the user to type a 5-word business rationale to request an override.60 |
| **Uncertainty Explanation** | Highlight gaps in knowledge or evidence.2 | Low NLI entailment scores; empty RAG sets.3 | Sketchy, hand-drawn vector borders over ungrounded claims.14 | Inline inside the generated text block.14 | **Delayed Disclosure CFF:** Hide the model's ungrounded suggestion for 10 seconds to prompt user reflection.61 |
| **Action Explanation** | Detail the consequences of a tool execution.4 | Pre-action database dependency graph trace.4 | Side-by-side comparison of "Current State" versus "Target State".25 | Dedicated transaction modal overlay.3 | **WhatIf CFF:** Force the user to complete a multiple-choice question on the impact of the action.37 |
| **Change Explanation** | Document changes applied by an edit.53 | Character diff hash comparisons.33 | Red (removed) and green (added) highlighted inline character text.33 | Inline text editor view. | **Audit CFF:** Require user signature commit validating each individual change.4 |
| **Failure Explanation** | Detail what broke and how to recover.3 | Standardized API exception return parameters.3 | Plain-language warning card with 3 action buttons.3 | Center-screen modal override layer.3 | **Diagnostic Timeout CFF:** Pause automated retries for 15 seconds to prevent thundering herd loops.3 |

To manage cognitive load, these explanation layers must deploy a pattern of *progressive disclosure*, preventing information density from overwhelming novice users while remaining fully inspectable for experts.23

```

          │  
          ▼ (User Clicks "Verify")  
 ───> Displays full coordinate highlights and secure API transaction ledgers 
```

This structural progression ensures that the system provides sufficient context without introducing unnecessary interaction friction.64

## **The Approval Flow Matrix**

Model-driven agents must never possess high-privilege credentials or the authority to commit destructive mutations silently.4 Approval is a critical security and compliance gate that must scale in direct proportion to transaction risk and action reversibility.3  
To prevent uncalibrated delegation and "autopilot complacency," approval flows must be concrete and highly specific.4 The user must approve explicit recipients, exact amounts, target files, parsed fields, account scopes, and downstream consequences—completely eliminating general, ambiguous continue prompts.4

| Action Class | Target Operations | Required Verification Signals | Allowed UI Gestures | Idempotency Key Format | Escalation & Recovery Playbooks |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Read-Only / Informational** | Querying weather, viewing invoice templates, checking status logs.10 | Session token matches active JWT; tenant ID verification.4 | None; execute instantly and display data.10 | IDEMP-READ-[user_id]-[hash] | Fallback to cached answers if the primary API fails.3 |
| **Draft Generation** | Generating email drafts, compiling research summaries, drafting reports.3 | Input text validation against schema; correct system prompt mapping.4 | Light hover preview card; click "Review Draft" button.3 | IDEMP-DRAFT-[session_id]-[seq] | Switch execution to a smaller, faster model if timeouts occur.3 |
| **External Communications** | Sending a Slack message, replying to a customer support ticket.4 | Entailment checks verify draft matches policy; safety scan passes.4 | Click prominent "Send Message" button.3 | IDEMP-COMM-[message_id] | If validation fails, quarantine draft and alert trust-and-safety.4 |
| **Low-Risk Local Mutation** | Creating a checklist item, adding a calendar event.10 | Database row-level security constraints validated.4 | Click checkbox; inline drag-and-drop gesture.4 | IDEMP-MUT-[tenant_id]-[index] | Re-type characters slowly to clear inline validation errors.4 |
| **High-Risk Tool Actions** | Deleting system files, modifying administrative access directories.4 | Pre-action assertions confirm file path target is in sandboxed folder.4 | Multi-step interactive checklists; explicit password re-entry.4 | IDEMP-SYS-[file_id]-[timestamp] | Halt process, restore target directory from snapshot, alert admin.4 |
| **Financial / Legal / Admin** | Transferring funds, executing refunds, processing payments.4 | Strict coordinate check confirms value matches invoice page crop.4 | Slide-to-confirm horizontal gesture; biometric face/finger ID.4 | TXN-[year]-[index]-[hash] 4 | Halt payment, roll back billing database commits, route to supervisor.3 |
| **Irreversible Mutations** | Writing to permanent database directories; deploying infrastructure.4 | Signature validation confirms legal identity of human operator.4 | Manual typing of verification phrase (e.g., "DEPLOY FORCE").4 | IDEMP-DEPLOY-[infra_id] | Immediate container quarantine; trigger security incident response.4 |
| **Degraded-Mode Fallbacks** | Switching to stale cache; model downgrade routing.3 | Budget-aware gateway confirms current token burn rate is below limit.4 | Explicit select button: "Use Stale Cache" vs "Wait in Queue".3 | IDEMP-FALL-[route_id]-[token] | If queue remains saturated, route session variables to high-priority backup.3 |

This granular mapping prevents the thundering herd of raw numbers from overwhelming the operator while ensuring that critical, dimension-specific failures (such as a high-correctness answer built on zero source support) are made immediately legible.14

## **The Edit Capture Model**

User edits inside generative AI applications are not merely cosmetic modifications; they function as active behavioral signals and governed feedback artifacts.14 Tracking these edits precisely enables the system to construct reliable audit trails, adjust context tenure, and refine local memory boundaries.4 However, the system must enforce a strict data-governance rule: *a human correction is not automatically free training data*.4 Edits can contain highly sensitive, legally protected, or tenant-specific personal data that must never be allowed to contaminate base model weights.4  
To preserve privacy and ensure strict compliance with regional regulations (such as GDPR and HIPAA), the system must route captured edits through distinct governance pathways, validating user consent and applying automated redaction filters before saving any telemetry.3

| Edit Class | Description / Example | Capture Mechanism | Target Destination Route | Retention & Consent Scope | Compliance & Security Gates |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Stylistic** | Adjusting tone, rewriting sentences, shortening paragraphs.3 | Character-level keypress diff trackers in the IDE view.26 | In-memory conversation history; active prompt template memory.41 | Session lifetime; cleared automatically upon window exit.3 | Standard CORS origin security checks.4 |
| **Factual** | Correcting dates, overwriting financial figures, replacing names.4 | Form element input value validation change listeners.4 | Active relational database row; local session memory storage.3 | Permanent relational database storage; bound to active account.4 | pgvector Row-Level Security checks filter permissions.4 |
| **Source / Citation** | Changing target reference document, adding a citation.4 | Custom sidebar drag-and-drop link actions.56 | Active context manifest; secure retrieval database path.4 | Document lifecycle; deleted if parent document is deleted.4 | Pre-filter authorization checks confirm folder access.4 |
| **Format** | Adding bullet points, formatting tables, wrapping code blocks.4 | Markdown WYSIWYG editor component listeners.27 | Downstream layout parsing engine templates.10 | Workspace scope; shared across tenant workspace users.4 | Input santiation scripts strip unapproved HTML comments.4 |
| **Policy** | Adjusting standard safety settings, updating compliance rules.4 | Administrative setting slider value change events.14 | Active system prompt compiler; gateway policy engine.4 | Permanent tenant configurations storage directory.4 | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) verifies admin role.4 |
| **Parameter** | Modifying model temperature, adjusting vector retrieval limits.4 | Slider UI elements mapping to JSON parameters.14 | Active API provider request payload compiler.3 | Session lifetime; resets to system defaults on exit.3 | Budget-aware gateway confirms parameters fall in safety bounds.4 |
| **Safety** | Redacting a personal field, flagging unapproved output.4 | Prominent UI "Report Safety Violation" alert buttons.4 | SIEM logs directory; trust-and-safety review vault.4 | Permanent compliance log; encrypted and offline.4 | Access restricted strictly to trust-and-safety security groups.4 |
| **Preference** | Choosing a preferred model, setting default languages.3 | User profile account checklist selection forms.4 | Permanent PostgreSQL user settings table.4 | Permanent until manual user deletion request.4 | GDPR "Right to be Forgotten" programmatic API hook.4 |
| **Domain-Rule** | Overriding an automated code suggestion, fixing syntax.3 | Active code editor character delta trace logs.27 | CI/CD evaluation harness datasets repository.4 | Retained for 90 days to run regression validation testing.4 | Strips all comments, names, and IP addresses before compile.4 |

```

This multi-tiered routing ensures that user corrections function as secure, compliant trust signals that continuously update system states without exposing sensitive enterprise records to training data contamination.4

## **The Undo, Rollback, and Compensation Model**

When an automated agent executes a multi-step workflow across distributed databases and external APIs, a failure at a later step can leave the system in an inconsistent state.28 To preserve data integrity and maintain user trust, architectures must implement the Saga Pattern.28 A Saga decomposes a long-running distributed transaction into a sequence of local, atomic transactions.28  
Each step in a Saga is categorized into three transactional classes 30:

1. **Compensatable Transactions**: Early steps that update local databases and can be semantically undone.30  
2. **Pivot Transaction**: The critical point of no return.30 If the pivot transaction succeeds, the Saga is effectively guaranteed to complete; if it fails, the Saga must execute compensating transactions for all preceding steps.30  
3. **Retriable Transactions**: Steps occurring after the pivot transaction that cannot fail for business reasons and must complete eventually.30

To coordinate these transactions safely under degradation, the interface must explicitly communicate reversibility *prior* to user approval, protecting users from unexpected terminal states.3

| Transaction Class | Target UI Elements | Underlying System Mechanism | Visual Reversibility Indicator | User Interface Control Pattern | Failure Recovery Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Compensatable** | Input form fields, uncommitted text drafts, temporary files.3 | Local application state cache rollback; memory layer resets.3 | Rotating curved arrow; active "Undo [Action]" toast banner.3 | Click inline "Undo" button; standard Cmd+Z keypress.3 | Revert local UI components to preceding values; clear caches.3 |
| **Pivot Transaction** | Place Order, Submit Payment, Deploy Code buttons.4 | Saga orchestrator commits the atomic transaction to the database.30 | Progress bar with lock icon; bold label: "Point of No Return".3 | Full-screen modal overlay requiring explicit PIN verification.3 | Halt execution; trigger Saga orchestrator to rollback completed steps.4 |
| **Retriable** | Background billing scans, analytics logs, system notifications.4 | Event-driven microservices running retry loops with exponential backoff.30 | Pulsing gray dot; progress spinner with status text.3 | "Pause Task Execution" button; "Force Sync State" control.3 | Run retry loop with randomized jitter desynchronization.3 |
| **Compensating** | Refund Payment, Release Reserved Inventory commands.45 | Saga choreography publishes rollback events to message brokers.29 | Muted warning status card: "Transaction reversed; refunding".3 | None; executes programmatically in the background on failure.45 | Execute compensating transaction with identical idempotency keys.4 |
| **Mitigating** | Email cancellation notifications, best-effort recalls.25 | Post-pivot asynchronous email/API cancellation requests.25 | Status banner: "Cancellation request sent; awaiting confirmation".3 | Click prominent "Request Recall" button.3 | Log recall attempts inside append-only security trace files.3 |
| **No-Undo Case** | Permanent database deletions, finalized bank wire transfers.4 | Irreversible, post-pivot committed physical transactions.4 | Red lock icon; static warning card: "This action cannot be undone".3 | Disabled and grayed-out controls; unclickable buttons.3 | Pause execution; compile escalation package for human audit.3 |

```
        ───> (Success) ───>  
          │                        │ (Failure)                     │  
          ▼ (Compensate)           ▼                               ▼ (Retry with Jitter)  
Refund Billing database   Cancel Order transaction       Retry Shipping dispatch API
```

This mapping guarantees that the interface is directly aligned with distributed microservice transactional states, preventing the system from vocalizing or displaying a completion confirmation until the underlying ledger change has been verified as committed.3

## **The Human Correction Loop Model**

A resilient interface must allow users to correct system errors cheaply and efficiently, routing each correction to the appropriate architectural layer rather than blindly restarting the entire session.14 When a user edits an ungrounded claim, corrects a malformed tool argument, or overrides a stale database query, the system must parse the intent and execute target updates.4  
To ensure system security, human corrections cannot be processed blindly.4 User inputs must be validated against system schemas, permissions tables, and context filters to block malicious modifications or un-entitled privilege escalations.4

| Correction Type | Detected Interface Event | Target Architectural Layer | Real-Time State Preservation | Target Correction Validation Code |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Wrong Source** | User overrides auto-retrieved PDF link in the sidebar.4 | **Retrieval Query Layer**: Ingress index filtering coordinates.4 | Retains active document metadata; discards unapproved vectors.4 | query.filter("owner_id", active_user) 4 |
| **Unsupported Citation** | User removes an inline citation badge from the text flow.54 | **Context Manifest Layer**: Context assembly document array.4 | Updates context manifest; recalculates token usage.4 | manifest.remove_document(doc_uuid) 4 |
| **Stale Date** | User overwrites a database date field inside a form.4 | **Relational DB Layer**: PostgreSQL transactional record row.4 | Commits the updated date with a version_status tag.4 | db.update().set("date", user_input) 4 |
| **Incorrect Field** | User modifies a populated tool argument before execution.4 | **Parser / Schema Layer**: Pydantic input arguments payload.4 | Saves edited arguments; locks the field to prevent override.4 | ProductionContract.model_validate(arguments) 4 |
| **Wrong Tone** | User selects a different style setting from a slider.14 | **Model Prompt Layer**: Prompt template system variables.4 | Re-compiles system prompt; preserves current chat history.4 | prompt.set_parameter("tone", user_tone) 4 |
| **Unverified Action** | User clicks "Cancel" inside a payment approval modal.3 | **Tool Permission Layer**: Ephemeral KMS credential broker.4 | Discards uncommitted token; reverts UI to draft state.3 | credential_manager.revoke_token(token_id) 4 |
| **Missing Document** | User uploads an additional reference PDF.10 | **Ingestion / Parser Layer**: Document layout preservation converter.10 | Rasterizes file to 300 DPI; compiles to DocTags markup.10 | docling.convert(uploaded_file.bytes) 10 |
| **Unsafe Suggestion** | User flags an inappropriate output claim.4 | **Safety / Moderation Layer**: Downstream ARGUS regex filter.4 | Quarantines session variables; alerts trust-and-safety.4 | argus.add_violation_pattern(claim_text) 4 |
| **Bad Extraction** | User edits characters inside an OCR-extracted grid field.10 | **OCR / Layout Graph Layer**: S-TSR split-merge coordinate cell.10 | Corrects cell value; updates GriTS validation score.10 | table.set_cell_value(row, col, user_input) 10 |
| **Wrong Account** | User selects a different account from a dropdown menu.4 | **Session Directory Layer**: Relational user permissions map.4 | Swaps active session keys; checks role access.4 | session.verify_tenant_access(new_account) 4 |
| **"Undo That"** | User clicks the horizontal undo arrow after tool runs.3 | **Saga Execution Layer**: Saga distributed orchestrator.45 | Triggers compensating transaction programmatically.45 | saga_orchestrator.reverse_step(step_id) 45 |

By implementing this granular correction architecture, the system allows the operator to intervene at any point in a multi-step sequence without losing accumulated session context, establishing a collaborative, resilient feedback loop.3

## **The Overtrust and Undertrust Failure Map**

High-dimensional AI products fail when probabilistic anomalies cross interfaces in forms that downstream systems or humans cannot safely interpret.4 Miscalibrated interfaces are the primary delivery vectors for these failures, transforming ordinary model fluctuations into severe production incidents.1  
The Overtrust and Undertrust Failure Map catalogs these pathologies, defining their visual symptoms, underlying architectural causes, detection signals, and engineering mitigations.1

| Trust Failure Pathology | Interface Symptom | User-Facing Risk | Systemic Cause | Dynamic Detection Signal | Operational Mitigation | Evaluation Method |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Automation Complacency** 42 | User bypasses verification; clicks "Approve" instantly on all steps.3 | Erroneous mutations executed; silent data corruption.4 | Low-friction modal designs; uniform green checkmark signaling.3 | Average modal approval duration < 350 ms over 5 trials.4 | **Assumptions CFF:** Force analytical delay; require manual checkbox commits.37 | Evaluate user error-detection accuracy under forced interaction delays.60 |
| **Citation Theater** 4 | Output displays dense inline citation badges for every claim.54 | False reassurance; user assumes claims are grounded.4 | Model generates bracketed numbers as formatting tokens post-hoc.4 | NLI entailment classifier scores drop below 0.70 on claims.4 | **Snappy Integration:** Run coordinate-level quote checks before rendering badge.4 | Measure citation recall and precision via the ALCE evaluation benchmark.68 |
| **Provenance Theater** 4 | Static "Verified Genuine" shield badge displayed globally.50 | Fake security claims; user trusts spoofed documents.4 | Static UI graphic assets; no cryptographic signature checks.4 | C2PA validator returns signingCredential.untrusted error.21 | **C2PA Enforcement:** Run local JUMBF extraction; verify X.509 cert status.21 | Subject the verification client to corrupted manifest injections in CI/CD.4 |
| **Explanation Theater** 4 | Detailed, eloquent reasoning paragraphs accompany every suggestion.59 | Overreliance; user deferral to model logic.7 | Temperature-inflated model generates persuasive rationales.4 | Lengthy rationales (> 150 words) lack coordinate-linked proof.4 | **Evidence First:** Suppress narrative explanations; display visual layouts only.4 | Run user studies testing opinion revision rate on incorrect claims.37 |
| **Warning Blindness** 4 | Muted warning banners displayed on every panel.3 | User ignores high-risk safety warnings.4 | Static, non-graded uncertainty display thresholds.14 | Warning click-through rate falls below 0.5% globally.4 | **Display Ladder:** Implement strict escalations; hide low-risk cues.14 | Track warning click-through rates and ignore durations.4 |
| **Correction Evaporation** | User-edited values revert to model choices on next turn.4 | Algorithm aversion; task abandonment.3 | Session state variables un-saved; prompt overrides edits.3 | Edits rewritten within 3 conversational turns.26 | **Lockstep State:** Serialize edits; append to strict system prompt boundaries.3 | Run multi-turn consistency checks on user-overridden variables.4 |
| **Anthropomorphic Overconfidence** | Model conversational responses use "I know" or "I am certain".14 | High user over-reliance on subjective decisions.7 | Lack of persona guidelines inside system templates.4 | Model outputs unhedged certainty words on low-probability logits.2 | **Hedged Phrasing:** Inject "likely" or "probably" guidelines in prompt.2 | Evaluate model-text outputs using linguistic sentiment-certainty classifiers.4 |
| **Stale Cache Reliance** 3 | UI displays outdated data without timestamp markers.3 | Transaction failures due to inventory/balance mismatch.3 | Cache TTL thresholds set globally without context awareness.3 | Data query executing over expired database records.3 | **Validity Matrix:** Force cache invalidation on local DB mutations.3 | Run regression tests auditing data matching status across cache regions.4 |

## **Trust Interface Telemetry Guidance**

Evaluating and debugging stateful, probabilistic human-AI interfaces is impossible using static backend logs alone.3 Security, reliability, and usability engineering require continuous, real-time tracking of interface interactions, logging events directly to secure SIEM databases.4  
To protect user privacy and prevent data leakage, the telemetry collection layer must enforce strict boundaries.4 All logs must be aggregated across users, stripped of personally identifiable information (PII) using regex redaction filters prior to save, and enforce an opt-out configuration for sensitive tenant spaces.4

| Telemetry Event Class | Standard Telemetry JSON Schema | Primary SRE Analysis Target | SLA Trigger Thresholds |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Citation Interaction** | { "event": "citation_open", "citation_id": "cite_12", "source_id": "doc_99", "hover_ms": 1420, "click_through": true } | Measures user validation engagement and source credibility perceptions.18 | Click-through rate < 2.0% flags poor citation visibility.18 |
| **Warning Disclosures** | { "event": "warning_rendered", "ladder_level": 3, "uncertainty_class": "retrieval_degraded", "user_dismissed": false } | Tracks warning blindness and alert fatigue rates.4 | Dismissal rate > 85% triggers warning escalation review.4 |
| **Cognitive Forcing** | { "event": "cff_triggered", "cff_type": "assumptions_analysis", "cognitive_load_nasa_tlx": 42, "opinion_revised": true } | Evaluates the behavioral effectiveness of cognitive forcing.37 | Revision rate < 15% on incorrect model recommendations.37 |
| **Edit Character Diff** | { "event": "edit_captured", "edit_class": "factual", "characters_added": 12, "characters_removed": 4, "target_layer": "db" } | Monitors system accuracy drift and user-visible failures.4 | Edit frequency > 25% of sessions flags model degradation.3 |
| **Transaction Approvals** | { "event": "approval_gesture", "gesture_type": "horizontal_slide", "duration_ms": 1120, "idempotency_key": "TXN-2026-9" } | Audits user compliance and complacency indicators.4 | Gesture duration < 250 ms flags high commission risk.42 |
| **Undo State Recovery** | { "event": "undo_triggered", "transaction_class": "compensatable", "session_id": "sess_88", "recovery_time_ms": 45 } | Evaluates system resilience and recovery latency.3 | Undo frequency > 8.0% flags targeting ambiguity.3 |
| **Human Escalation** | { "event": "escalation_compiled", "trigger_reason": "low_confidence", "package_size_bytes": 14202, "redacted": true } | Monitors platform queue congestion and support costs.3 | Escalation rate > 5.0% of rolling daily traffic.3 |

Tracing these telemetry metrics programmatically allows SRE and product teams to detect trust miscalibration trends (such as a sudden drop in citation click-throughs combined with rapid transaction approvals) before they result in uncontained production incidents.4

## **Strategic Conclusions and Architectural Recommendations**

Building a resilient, high-dimensional human-AI collaboration system requires a fundamental shift in user interface design posture.3 Probabilistic systems fail in complex, non-deterministic ways that traditional web architectures are not equipped to contain.3 Platforms that rely on model-level self-policing or simple prompt-based guardrails remain highly vulnerable to context dilution, prompt injection, and catastrophic session crashes.4 True interface resilience is achieved by treating the human-system interface as a strict, software-enforced reliance-calibration layer operating outside the model's execution path.2  
To implement a robust, production-grade trust-calibration interface, architects and product teams should adopt the following six core design principles:

### **I. Prioritize Active Verification over Fluent Prose**

The interface must suppress long, persuasive model-generated reasoning narratives in high-stakes tasks, preferring concise, inspectable evidence displays, page-level coordinate highlights, and structural data grids.4 A detailed text justification must never substitute for verifiable evidence provenance.4

### **II. Enforce Plan-Focused Cognitive Forcing Functions**

To counteract automation complacency and uncritical acceptance of AI-generated workflows, interfaces must interleave targeted cognitive forcing interventions.37 Designers should prioritize *Assumptions CFFs* (argument analysis asking users to evaluate plan premises) over *WhatIf CFFs* (hypothesis testing), as empirical evaluations prove that Assumptions CFFs decrease the rate of user error acceptance to 22% without adding measurable NASA-TLX cognitive load.37

### **III. Embed Cryptographic Provenance using the C2PA Standard**

Every image, document, chart, or voice stream delivered or processed by the system must carry an unbroken, cryptographically signed chain of custody.10 Verifiers must validate assertions, check certificate status against the C2PA Trust List, and confirm hard-binding binary hashes to expose tampering immediately.21 Provenance theater—displaying static, unverified checkmarks—is strictly prohibited.4

### **IV. Restrict Action Execution to Eventual Consistency Sagas**

Automated agents must never execute side-effecting mutations without strict approval gating and explicit state tracking.4 Implement the Saga distributed transaction pattern, clearly defining compensatable, pivot, and retriable steps.30 The dialogue coordinator must never vocalize or display a completion confirmation (e.g., "Your payment has been sent") until the underlying transaction is committed and verified inside the database of record.3 Spoken or generated claims must never outrun physical reality.4

### **V. Align User Preference with Objective Performance Evidence**

Product design decisions must be informed by behavioral reliance telemetry rather than subjective user feedback.5 Empirical evaluations reveal a persistent mismatch where users perceive complex, high-friction interventions (such as hypothesis-testing CFFs) as highly helpful, yet achieve significantly better error-detection accuracy under low-friction, argument-focused controls.37 System telemetry must track citation opens, hover times, undo triggers, and edit character diffs to monitor and calibrate this loop in production.3

### **VI. Decouple Quota, Cache, and Security Boundaries Programmatically**

Never compromise data isolation, tenant partitioning, or security boundaries to maintain system availability during degraded modes.3 Multi-tenant SaaS deployments must enforce database Row-Level Security, separate vector index partitions, and cryptographically bind semantic cache keys to prevent thundering herd loops or prefix-caching side-channel timing exploits across users.3 The system must degrade gracefully along explicit quality bands, preserving user intent and session variables across all fallback states.3

## **Durable Principles of UX Resilience**

1. **Fallback Is Not Success**  
   A fallback succeeds only when it preserves the task’s safety, quality, state, privacy, evidence, and user expectations.

2. **Degraded Mode Must Be Designed, Not Discovered**  
   Users should not experience degraded capability as random weirdness. Degraded states need labels, continuity, safe options, and clear next steps.

3. **Silent Routing Is Allowed Only for Equivalent Capability**  
   If the fallback changes quality, freshness, latency, cost, evidence, or action authority, the user or UI needs to know.

4. **Never Trade Safety for Availability**  
   Tenant isolation, privacy, authorization, action verification, and consent are non-sacrificable. A system that stays “up” by dropping those is not resilient. It is just failing with jazz hands.

5. **Preserve State Before Changing Route**  
   Route switches, retries, partial answers, and escalations must preserve user goal, active constraints, files, drafts, approvals, and action ledger state.

6. **Unknown Action State Must Be Shown as Unknown**  
   Tool timeouts, payment uncertainty, browser crashes, and partial commits must not become conversational success claims.

7. **Cached Answers Require Scope, Freshness, and Disclosure**  
   Cache reuse must respect tenant/user scope, source version, policy version, and task risk. Stale cache must be labeled or blocked.

8. **Partial Answers Must Preserve Boundaries**  
   A partial answer should clearly separate what is known, unavailable, failed, pending, unverified, and safe to retry.

9. **Human Escalation Is a Product State**  
   Escalation should transfer scoped, redacted, actionable context—not dump raw chat history into a queue and call it “support.”

10. **Graceful Errors Should Reduce User Work**  
   A graceful error tells the user what failed, what succeeded, what was saved, whether retry is safe, and what options remain.

11. **Retry UX Must Prevent Duplicate Harm**  
   Read-only retries may be automated within limits. State-changing retries require idempotency, verification, and sometimes explicit user approval.

12. **Degradation Must Be Observable**  
   Every fallback, cache response, partial answer, retry sequence, fail-closed event, and escalation should emit traceable telemetry.
