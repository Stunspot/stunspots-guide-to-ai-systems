# AI-ENG-Q — Speech, Voice, and Real-Time Interaction Systems

Real-time voice systems represent a fundamental departure from traditional request-response text architectures. In a text-based system, information arrives as a complete, static artifact with explicit, deterministic boundaries. In contrast, spoken human interaction is a continuous, bi-directional, temporal stream where timing, pauses, overlaps, pitch, and physical acoustics carry critical semantic meaning.1 A real-time voice interaction system cannot be built merely by wrapping a text-based Large Language Model (LLM) in batch transcription and text-to-speech APIs.4 When voice interfaces are treated as text generation with audio input/output bolted on, the resulting systems fail under human conversational norms, manifesting high latency, false endpointing, fragile interruption mechanics, and unsafe tool execution on unstable transcripts.4  
The foundational architecture of a high-dimensional real-time voice system is therefore defined as a temporal state-coordination system. This architecture must process continuous streaming media under strict latency budgets, manage the conversational floor across overlapping speaker turns, filter background noise and echo to allow natural user barge-in, repair verbal misunderstandings without degrading progressivity, verify identity, and protect agentic tools from executing on partial or misheard intents.4  
This report establishes the system architecture, state models, and operational profiles required to build resilient, latency-bounded, and safe real-time voice systems.

## **Realtime Voice Interaction Pipeline**

A production-grade real-time voice system operates as a distributed, stream-aligned architecture. The end-to-end pipeline must coordinate multiple asynchronous systems, each running on distinct clocks, over low-latency media transport protocols.4

### **Media Transport Infrastructure and Session Edge Architecture**

Traditional request-response architectures terminate traffic using standard stateless HTTP endpoints. For real-time voice, bidirectional transport must bypass standard TCP handshakes to avoid the latency penalties of congestion control and packet retransmission.4 Production systems implement a hybrid architecture of WebRTC and WebSockets 31:

* **WebSockets**: Effective for control signaling, session setup, and low-concurrency streaming where packet-loss handling (TCP) does not introduce latency cliffs under clean network conditions.4  
* **WebRTC**: The standard for production-grade, high-scale bidirectional media transport.31 WebRTC utilizes UDP as its base transport, wrapping packets in Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for media and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for key exchange.30

To avoid the overhead of multi-party Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) where the AI acts as a participant in a group session, production systems for 1:1 interactions use a **Transceiver Edge Model**.30 In this model, a geographically distributed edge service terminates downstream WebRTC connections directly, handling Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), DTLS handshakes, and SRTP decryption at the edge.30 The decrypted media is then converted into lightweight, internal protocols (such as raw gRPC or flat UDP streams) for upstream routing to model inference and orchestration clusters.30  
To route incoming UDP media packets to the correct stateful transceiver instance without an expensive database lookup on every packet, systems route on **ICE Credentials**.30 During Session Description Protocol (SDP) negotiation, the edge service generates a unique ICE username fragment (ufrag) containing encoded routing metadata.30 When the client sends its first STUN binding request to establish connectivity, the stateless network load balancers parse the ufrag from the STUN header and steer the UDP stream to the designated transceiver container.30 If a transceiver or relay restarts, the next incoming STUN packet rebuilds the path instantly based on the ufrag routing hint.30

### **Audio Evidence Provenance**

To maintain consistency and auditability, real-time voice systems must preserve a continuous trace mapping generated text tokens and tool calls back to the raw source audio segments. Every audio frame ingested by the transceiver edge is assigned a monotonically increasing timestamp and sequence identifier. The streaming STT engine maps word-level start and end times back to these frame offsets.4  
When the dialogue coordinator transitions its state or triggers an external tool contract, it logs the precise audio segment boundaries and transcript stability states that justified the action. This ensures that every mutation can be audited back to the raw physical signal, protecting against hallucinations or errors where a tool executes on ungrounded text.

### **Media Plane and Signal Plane Execution Pipeline**

The execution flow of the real-time voice pipeline translates physical acoustic pressure into state transformations and back into physical acoustics.4 The pipeline segments these responsibilities into distinct software layers.

| Sequence Stage | Local Pipeline Step | Executing Infrastructure Layer | Local Protocol / Format | Critical Failure Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1. Capture** | Microphone Audio Ingestion | Client-side App (Native SDK) | Linear PCM 16-bit, 16kHz, Mono 33 | Audio capture permission block 28 |
| **2. Preprocess** | WebRTC AEC3 Echo & Noise Filtering | Client AudioWorklet (WebAssembly) 34 | Float32 Internal -> PCM conversion 34 | Adaptive filter divergence on Android 35 |
| **3. Encode** | Audio Frame Compression | Client Opus Encoder | Opus packets over UDP (WebRTC) 34 | Packet dropped due to local thread lag 34 |
| **4. Transport** | Secure Packet Uplink Transit | Public/Transit IP Network | DTLS/SRTP via WebRTC Transceiver 30 | Network jitter, cross-region routing delay 4 |
| **5. Terminate** | WebRTC termination & Decryption | Server Edge (Transceiver Cluster) 30 | Decrypted PCM Int16 raw buffer 30 | Ephemeral port exhaustion under Kubernetes 30 |
| **6. Local VAD** | Client/Server Double VAD pass | Server Edge (Silero Wasm Thread) 36 | 10/20ms Frame classification 18 | High False Positives on street background noise 5 |
| **7. Stream STT** | Acoustic-to-Linguistic Decoding | STT Engine (WebSocket Pool) 11 | Bidirectional WebSocket JSON 11 | Model drift, phonetic spelling failure 10 |
| **8. Revise** | Partial Transcript update cycle | Dialogue Context Manager | Interim results collection (is_final=False) 6 | Premature execution on highly volatile phrases 6 |
| **9. Endpoint** | Spoken turn completion parsing | Semantic Turn Classifier | Semantic & Prosodic Feature Scoring | Cutting off users with assistive stutters |
| **10. Reason** | Think-Before-Speak execution | LLM Agent Execution Cluster 38 | In-memory token representation 38 | Context window token ceiling, high TTFT |
| **11. Gate** | Spoken action authorization check | Security & Policy Layer | Action schema-to-transcript mapping | Executing destructive tool on misheard entity 9 |
| **12. Synthesize** | Neural speech output compilation | Streaming TTS Cluster (Sonic Engine) 5 | Opus/PCM stream segment output 5 | Audio gaps, mechanical voice sounding 4 |
| **13. Playback** | Waveform output conversion | Client App Playback Engine | PCM 16-bit, 24kHz, Mono 33 | Glitching "chipmunk effect" on mismatch 33 |
| **14. Log & Trace** | Comprehensive Session auditing | Observability Storage Platform 28 | Structured OpenTelemetry session JSON 28 | Exposing raw audio leaks, PI data breach 28 |

## **Speech-to-Text and Streaming Transcription**

Real-time transcription is more than batch speech recognition optimized for speed; it is an active perception pipeline that processes incomplete, overlapping, and changing audio structures.

### **Streaming STT State Model**

The streaming STT decoder operates as a stateful transition engine over rolling audio frames.6 It translates continuous acoustic feature vectors into structured linguistic hypotheses, distinguishing between unstable partial guesses and locked historical frames.6

| Origin State | Transition Trigger Event | Destination State | Retained State Metadata | Downstream System Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Acoustic Idle** | Energy level crosses VAD threshold 1 | **Active Frame Ingestion** | Prefix buffer, timestamp onset 5 | Open active STT decoder socket 11 |
| **Active Frame Ingestion** | First frame sequence completed (> 100 ms) 40 | **Partial Hypothesis** (is_final=False) 6 | Speculative text array, confidence score 6 | Render real-time UI captions 34 |
| **Partial Hypothesis** | Subsequent audio frame arrival 6 | **Hypothesis Revision Loop** | Word-level coordinate shifts 32 | Refine speculative intent classification 1 |
| **Hypothesis Revision Loop** | Acoustic probability entropy decreases below threshold 6 | **Locked Segment** (is_final=True) 6 | Solidified token sequence, word timestamps 41 | Append immutable text to LLM context 4 |
| **Locked Segment** | VAD registers silence > threshold 39 | **Utterance Boundary** (speech_final=True) 6 | Final turn sequence number, semantic tag 6 | Trigger model turn reasoning thread 4 |
| **Utterance Boundary** | Core agent response generated 4 | **Acoustic Idle** | Historical dialogue logs, tool receipts 28 | Transition client state back to listening 5 |

### **Transcript Stability Policy**

Because interim results are volatile, acting on them prematurely introduces systemic risk.6 For instance, if a user says, "I want to cancel... my cancellation request," a system acting on the first partial transcript ("I want to cancel") might trigger a destructive account mutation before the corrective phrase ("my cancellation request") is ever processed.6 To mitigate this, real-time architectures enforce a strict **Transcript Stability Policy** that maps permitted system behaviors to transcript states.

| Transcript State | Stability Criteria | Permitted Actions | Prohibited Actions | Recovery Protocol |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Volatile Partial** (is_final: false, Stability < 0.70) 6 | Initial phoneme matching, highly subject to downstream linguistic revision.6 | Local UI caption rendering, speculative intent classification.6 | LLM context serialization, tool execution, external state mutations. | Silently discard the segment if updated frames diverge.6 |
| **Stable Speculative** (is_final: false, Stability >= 0.70) 6 | High acoustic confidence, but waiting for linguistic boundary resolution.11 | Pre-fetching read-only API data, pre-warming vector indexes.4 | Dispatching user replies, committing payments, updating external records. | Flush speculative state cache if final result differs.5 |
| **Locked Segment** (is_final: true, speech_final: false) 6 | Decoder has finalized the phoneme-to-text mapping.6 | Appending text to conversational history, routing to reasoning LLM.4 | Triggering irreversible tools without explicit spoken confirmation. | Wait for final utterance boundary or explicit pause.6 |
| **Utterance Complete** (is_final: true, speech_final: true) 6 | Segment is finalized and the user has executed a valid turn boundary.6 | Executing safe read-only queries, triggering standard dialog response.42 | Mutating critical user accounts or executing high-impact tools. | Validate turn completion against semantic VAD before speaking. |

### **Multilingual Dynamics and Keyterm Prompting**

Under multilingual and code-switching constraints, the STT engine must run dynamic, low-latency streaming language identification.12 If the speaker switches from English to Spanish mid-sentence, a monolingual decoder will hallucinate phonetic approximations, introducing transcription errors.12 Production systems employ parallel acoustic language-identification heads that dynamically adjust the decoder's language model matrix.12  
To maintain high accuracy for specialized, domain-specific vocabularies (such as product names, medical codes, or user-specific contact lists), the STT connection is initialized with a **Keyterm Prompting List**.12 This dynamically biases the decoder's decoding graph towards specified proper nouns or acronyms, substantially reducing entity-specific WER on prioritized domain terms when the keyterm list is well maintained.12

## **Voice Activity Detection, Endpointing, and Turn Boundaries**

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Endpointing are distinct control systems within the real-time interaction loop.20 VAD is a low-level, frame-by-frame acoustic classifier that determines the presence or absence of human speech.1 Endpointing is a higher-level, context-aware decision process that determines whether the user has completed their conversational turn and yielded the floor to the assistant.1

### **Endpointing and Turn-Detection Model**

Standard energy-based VAD systems rely on simple volume thresholds: if the audio signal amplitude drops below a specified level for a fixed duration, the system assumes the user has stopped speaking. In production environments, this fails in both directions. Background noise can prevent endpointing, while thoughtful pauses, breath timing, stutters, or mid-sentence planning pauses can trigger premature endpointing.

Modern architectures deploy a **Hybrid Semantic-Acoustic Endpointing Model**. This system combines low-latency acoustic VAD with semantic and prosodic turn-completion features.

The model evaluates:

* **Acoustic speech probability:** frame-level estimate of whether human speech is present.
* **Silence duration:** how long the current gap has lasted.
* **Linguistic completeness:** whether the transcript appears syntactically or semantically complete.
* **Prosodic contour:** whether pitch, rhythm, and trailing intonation imply continuation or completion.
* **Floor-holding signals:** fillers, conjunctions, discourse markers, stutters, repeated syllables, and unfinished clauses.
* **Risk context:** whether the turn may trigger a high-impact action requiring extra confirmation.

|
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Policy:
|   VAD detects speech.
|   Endpointing decides whether the turn is complete.
|   Silence alone is not a turn boundary.
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

When silence is detected acoustically, the system calculates a dynamic hangover window:

| Condition | Endpointing Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| Transcript is complete and low-risk | Endpoint quickly after a short silence window. |
| Transcript ends with filler, conjunction, or unfinished phrase | Extend silence window and preserve user floor. |
| User profile indicates stutter, aphasia, dysarthria, or slow pacing | Use accessibility profile and longer endpoint window. |
| Environment is noisy | Require stronger speech/silence confidence and semantic confirmation. |
| High-impact action is possible | Require final transcript, semantic completeness, and explicit confirmation. |
| Barge-in or correction is detected | Yield assistant floor immediately and enter repair/interruption path. |

To programmatically control this behavior, production platforms expose VAD and endpointing parameters such as acoustic threshold, prefix padding, silence duration, semantic eagerness, min/max turn silence, and interruption delay. These parameters should be treated as **policy profiles**, not universal constants.

### **Endpointing Policy Profiles**

A single endpointing configuration cannot satisfy all conversational contexts. A fast response is desirable for home automation commands, but causes frustration during complex cognitive tasks or for users with speech impairments.1 Architectures must implement specialized **Endpointing Policy Profiles**.1

| Profile Name | Target Use Case | Silence Threshold (T_silence) | VAD Sensitivity / Energy Threshold | Semantic Guarding Policy | Target User Segment / Context |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Command & Control** | Voice-driven utility execution (e.g., "turn on lights"). | 200 ms - 300 ms 19 | High sensitivity / Low energy threshold (aggressive).39 | Disabled; execute instantly on keyword detection.39 | Hands-busy environments, low cognitive overhead.46 |
| **Casual Conversation** | Natural, open-ended dialog.4 | 400 ms - 600 ms 19 | Moderate sensitivity (balance noise vs speech).18 | Enabled; verify clause resolution before yielding floor. | Standard customer service, informational voicebots.4 |
| **Dictation / Transcription** | Continuous spoken capture, long paragraphs.10 | 1200 ms - 2000 ms 21 | High sensitivity; long hangover padding.17 | Disabled; wait for explicit "period" keyword or long pause.21 | Legal, medical, or administrative text entry.10 |
| **High-Impact Action** | Financial mutations, secure database changes.28 | 800 ms - 1200 ms 19 | Low sensitivity (avoid false starts on noise).39 | Strict; require full grammatical resolution plus readback. | Banking, secure credential updates, account changes.28 |
| **Inclusive / Accessibility** | Support stutters, slow pacing, dysarthria.46 | 1500 ms - 3000 ms 19 | High tolerance; ignore rapid repetitive syllable bursts. | Strict; disable endpointing on repetitive sound patterns. | Users with neurological speech differences.46 |
| **Noisy Environment** | Cafes, open offices, industrial floors.17 | 600 ms - 1000 ms 19 | Low sensitivity / High energy threshold (WebRTC level 3).19 | Enabled; filter out sudden ambient sound spikes.1 | Mobile users, field operations, public transport.17 |
| **Group Conversation** | Multi-speaker business meetings, panels.3 | 800 ms - 1500 ms 3 | High sensitivity + Speaker Diarization mapping.3 | Strict; keep turn open if primary speaker pauses but holds floor.1 | Corporate boardrooms, multi-party calls.3 |

## **Turn-Taking and Dialogue State**

Turn-taking is managed by a state machine that tracks floor ownership. The system must prevent overtalk (where both speak simultaneously) and dead air (where neither speaks), transitioning states based on VAD, transcript stability, and semantic completions.22

### **Turn-Taking State Machine**

The following matrix defines the state transitions of the Turn-Taking State Machine.

| Source State | Input Event Trigger | Destination State | Triggering Mechanism | State Machine System Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **IDLE** | VAD Speech Started | **LISTENING** | Audio energy level crosses VAD threshold 1 | Open streaming ASR connection, start context buffering.4 |
| **LISTENING** | Partial Transcript Received | **PROVISIONAL_TRANSCRIPT** | Interim results payload parsed from socket 6 | Render real-time visual captions, pre-warm caches.4 |
| **PROVISIONAL_TRANSCRIPT** | VAD Silence > threshold | **ENDPOINT_CANDIDATE** | Local silence timer passes 300 ms window 19 | Halt active transcript appending, trigger turn completion model. |
| **ENDPOINT_CANDIDATE** | Semantic Resolution Completed | **USER_TURN_FINAL** | Turn completeness model returns probability > 0.85 | Lock finalized ASR transcript segment, compile prompt.6 |
| **ENDPOINT_CANDIDATE** | New Speech Detected | **LISTENING** | Audio energy level crosses threshold before timeout 1 | Reset local silence timer, continue transcript stream.1 |
| **ENDPOINT_CANDIDATE** | Timeout Exceeded | **USER_TURN_FINAL** | Silence duration passes forced floor timeout 21 | Force close the active speaking turn.21 |
| **USER_TURN_FINAL** | Dialogue Reasoning Invoked | **THINKING** | Prompt dispatched to core agent LLM 4 | Execute tool gating checks, initiate reasoning thread.9 |
| **THINKING** | API/Tool Execution Invoked | **TOOL_CHECKING** | LLM outputs speculative tool schema 4 | Suspend spoken generation, route parameters to tool runner.28 |
| **TOOL_CHECKING** | Tool Return Verified | **THINKING** | API response parsed and validated 4 | Append tool payload to context, resume linguistic path.4 |
| **THINKING** | First Linguistic Token Emitted | **SPEAKING** | LLM outputs structural response token | Launch streaming TTS pipeline, initialize client playback. |
| **SPEAKING** | LLM Stream Paused Mid-Turn | **BACKCHANNELING** | LLM outputs explicit wait or placeholder token | Play light acoustic feedback gesture ("uh-huh"). |
| **SPEAKING** | VAD Speech Started (Barge-In) | **INTERRUPTED** | User interrupts playing assistant stream 5 | Flush client-side audio buffer, cancel reasoning.5 |
| **SPEAKING** | Synthesis Complete | **IDLE** | Audio playback playhead reaches termination marker 1 | Reset dialogue state flags, return to passive listening.5 |
| **INTERRUPTED** | Interruption Processing Complete | **REPAIR** | Truncation playhead timestamp aligned 5 | Log partial response, load repair conversational patterns.5 |
| **REPAIR** | Misunderstanding Resolved | **THINKING** | User confirmation text committed 8 | Compile corrected prompt, restart generation thread.4 |
| **IDLE / LISTENING** | Critical Protocol Loss | **TERMINATED** | Media socket connection drops > 30 s 16 | Tear down WebRTC transceiver paths, log metrics.30 |

### **Conversational Dynamics**

To maintain natural dialogue flow, the dialogue coordinator must distinguish between different communicative actions:

* **User Turn**: The user has the floor and is transmitting semantic intent.4  
* **Assistant Turn**: The agent has the floor and is playing audio.  
* **Backchannel**: A non-intrusive vocal gesture (e.g., "uh-huh") emitted by the listener. When the user is speaking and emits a brief pause, the assistant may issue a backchannel to signal active listening. This does not trigger an assistant turn transition.  
* **Floor Holding**: The user pauses but emits acoustic filler signals ("uhhh") or grammatical continuity markers ("because...") indicating they intend to retain the floor.  
* **Turn Yield**: The active speaker completes their statement and explicitly yields the floor, marked by falling pitch contours and silence.22  
* **Barge-In / Overlap**: Both speakers speak simultaneously.5 The coordinator must classify this event: if the user's speech is a brief backchannel, the assistant continues speaking; if it is a structural correction or stop command, the assistant yields the floor immediately.  
* **Conversational Repair**: A sub-dialogue loop triggered when either party detects a communication breakdown, holding progressivity until mutual understanding is restored.7  
* **Confirmation Turn**: A dedicated turn where the system asks the user to confirm a high-risk entity or tool payload.  
* **Status Turn**: A temporary turn where the system informs the user of a background execution delay to prevent awkward silences.  
* **Handoff Turn**: An administrative turn transitioning floor control and context data to a human operator or fallback channel.

If the turn-taking state machine fails, several user-visible pathologies occur: **Overtalk** (the agent speaks over the user, causing frustration), **Dead Air** (the agent hesitates, leaving the user unsure if the connection is active), and **Clipped Speech** (the agent speaks too quickly, cutting off the end of the user's words).22

## **Latency Budgets and Realtime System Margins**

Human conversational turn-taking operates on a 200 ms to 500 ms rhythm.22 If a voice agent exceeds a 700 ms response delay, the interaction feels lagging or unresponsive.4 If it exceeds 1000 ms, the conversation breaks down as users assume a system error and repeat themselves, triggering race conditions.31

### **Realtime Latency Budget Model**

The perceived latency of a real-time voice system is not simply the sum of every component in the pipeline. Some stages are sequential, but many are pipelined or concurrent. P50 and P95 component latencies should therefore be used for budget allocation and bottleneck diagnosis, not blindly added as if all stages block the same critical path.

A useful latency model distinguishes:

| Latency Type | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **End-of-speech to first audio** | User stops speaking; assistant begins audible response. |
| **Partial-speech to speculative work** | User is still speaking; system prefetches, prewarms, or plans safely. |
| **Turn-complete to first token** | Finalized turn enters reasoning; model emits first linguistic token. |
| **First token to first audio** | Text stream begins; sentence/clause buffer and TTS produce audio. |
| **Barge-in latency** | User starts interrupting; assistant playback stops. |

```

To maintain this budget under real-world network conditions, latency margins must be allocated across system components:

| Processing Component | Technical Processing Step | Latency Margin (P50) | Latency Margin (P95) | Architectural Optimization Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Media Capture** | Microphone hardware capture, client buffering. | 10 ms | 20 ms | Bind audio capture to native client thread; restrict frame size to small buffers. |
| **Acoustic Preprocessing** | Echo cancellation, noise suppression, automatic gain control. | 15 ms | 30 ms | Run local AEC/noise suppression close to the microphone. |
| **Uplink Transport** | Opus encoding, DTLS/SRTP transit. | 40 ms | 110 ms | Route media to geographically close relay or edge ingress. |
| **VAD & Endpointing** | Acoustic VAD plus semantic/prosodic turn decision. | 35 ms | 75 ms | Keep endpointing lightweight and profile-aware. |
| **Streaming STT** | Acoustic-to-token decoding. | 150 ms | 320 ms | Use persistent streaming sessions; avoid batch transcription APIs. |
| **Dialogue State Update** | Context assembly and prompt/event formatting. | 5 ms | 12 ms | Keep active dialogue state in memory. |
| **Model Reasoning** | First useful token or first sentence plan. | 120 ms | 250 ms | Use low-latency model route for voice turns; prewarm where safe. |
| **Read-Only Tool Lookup** | Optional external lookup. | 180 ms | 380 ms | Prefetch only when safe; do not block filler/status speech unless required. |
| **Streaming TTS** | First audio chunk generation. | 90 ms | 180 ms | Stream audio chunks; avoid waiting for full response text. |
| **Downlink Transport** | Audio frame return to client. | 35 ms | 95 ms | Match packetization to client playback buffer. |
| **Playback Buffer** | Client jitter buffer and output. | 30 ms | 70 ms | Keep adaptive buffer small while avoiding underruns. |
| **Interruption Stop** | User barge-in to local playback mute. | 12 ms | 25 ms | Detect locally and mute before server round-trip. |
| **Recovery Latency** | Repair state setup after interruption. | 65 ms | 140 ms | Preserve playhead and partial-response markers. |

### **Pipeline Concurrency and Stream-Pipelining**

The critical path of a voice agent is optimized through stream-pipelining. In a sequential pipeline, the user waits for each stage to complete:

```text
T_sequential =
  T_STT_final
+ T_LLM_full_response
+ T_TTS_full_response
```

This can easily exceed natural turn-taking rhythm.

In a streaming pipeline, stages overlap:

```text
audio frames -> streaming STT -> partial/final turns
finalized turn -> LLM first tokens -> clause buffer
clause buffer -> TTS first chunk -> playback
LLM continues -> TTS continues -> playback continues
```

The perceived latency is closer to:

```text
T_first_audio =
  T_endpoint
+ T_context_assembly
+ T_LLM_first_useful_tokens
+ T_clause_buffer
+ T_TTS_first_audio
+ T_downlink_playback
```

Speculative work may begin earlier from stable partials, but high-risk actions must wait for final transcript, confirmation, and tool verification.

The practical doctrine:

```text
Pipeline aggressively for perception.
Gate conservatively for action.
Never let low latency become fast wrongness with a microphone.
```

## **Streaming Generation and Speech Output Policy**

When an agent begins playing back audio, it commits to a public trajectory. If the language model subsequently changes its reasoning or encounters a tool error, the agent cannot retroactively edit its spoken output without a jarring verbal correction. Systems require a strict **Streaming Response Policy** to balance generation speed with truthfulness and action-safety boundaries.

### **Streaming Response Policy**

When an agent begins playing audio, it commits to a public trajectory. Spoken output is harder to revise than text: the user hears it in time, reacts in time, and may act on it before the system can correct itself. Real-time voice systems therefore need a response policy that balances speed, truthfulness, interruption safety, and action verification.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| STREAMING RESPONSE POLICY

|
| [ User Turn Finalized ]
|          |
|          v
| [ Determine Response Dependency ]
|          |
|          +--> no external dependency
|          |       stream answer immediately
|          |
|          +--> read-only lookup
|          |       speak brief status / filler if useful
|          |       execute lookup
|          |       speak result after observation is received
|          |
|          +--> low-risk reversible mutation
|          |       validate payload
|          |       optionally confirm if ambiguity exists
|          |       execute
|          |       speak completion only after verified success
|          |
|          +--> high-risk or irreversible mutation
|                  read back payload
|                  require explicit confirmation
|                  execute through tool contract
|                  verify resulting state
|                  speak completion only after verification
|
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Rule:
|   The agent may speak status before verification.
|   The agent may not speak completion before verification.
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The dialogue engine should choose among four response paths:

| Response Path | When to Use | Allowed Speech Before Tool Result | Completion Claim Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate Conversational Streaming** | Low-risk conversation, explanation, brainstorming, or summarization from available context. | Full streaming response. | No external completion claim involved. |
| **Read-Only Lookup Path** | Order status, weather, schedule, inventory, account balance, or public/current lookup. | Filler/status such as “Let me check that.” | Speak result only after lookup observation is received and parsed. |
| **Low-Risk Mutation Path** | Reversible or local actions such as adding a note, draft, reminder, or checklist item. | Confirmation/status if needed. | Speak “done” only after execution result is verified or at least confirmed by authoritative tool result. |
| **High-Risk Mutation Path** | Money movement, deletion, external message send, access change, deployment, account mutation. | Clarification, readback, confirmation, and status only. | Speak completion only after action verification confirms the state change. |

Examples:

| Unsafe Spoken Output | Safer Spoken Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| “Your payment has been sent” before payment verification. | “I’m submitting the payment now. I’ll confirm once it’s verified.” |
| “I deleted the file” before filesystem readback. | “I’m processing the deletion. I’ll verify the file state before confirming.” |
| “Your appointment is booked” after only a pending calendar API response. | “The calendar request was accepted. I’m verifying the event before I call it booked.” |
| “I sent that email” before provider acknowledgment. | “I’m sending the email now. I’ll confirm once the mail service accepts it.” |

### **Speech Output UX Model**

Text formatted for visual layout is often unsuitable for speech. The speech generation engine should pass content through a **Speech Output Normalization Layer** before synthesis.

| Normalization Task | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Numerical normalization** | Speak numbers according to context: amount, code, phone number, account number, date, or measurement. |
| **Sensitive data filtering** | Avoid reading full secrets, passwords, tokens, account numbers, or private details aloud in unsafe contexts. |
| **Structural cleanup** | Remove Markdown syntax, raw URLs, HTML, JSON noise, and terminal artifacts. |
| **Alternate channel routing** | Send dense tables, long lists, code blocks, and private values to screen/text instead of voice. |
| **Prosodic segmentation** | Break long answers into short spoken clauses with pause points and interruption boundaries. |
| **Barge-in safety** | Track which text has been spoken so interruption recovery can resume or repair accurately. |

The spoken channel should be concise, truthful, interruptible, and grounded in verified state. It should not perform a dramatic live reading of a JSON blob unless everyone involved has made very poor life choices.

### **Speech Output UX Model**

Text formatted for visual layout is often unsuited for speech. Reading long code blocks, nested tables, markdown links, or dense raw numbers aloud increases cognitive load and causes conversational abandonment.17  
The speech generation engine must pass raw text through a **Speech Output Normalization Layer** before synthesis:

* **Numerical Normalization**: Translating raw digits into spoken representations based on context.10 For example, "Your account balance is $1520.50" is normalized to "Your account balance is fifteen twenty dollars and fifty cents," whereas "Your account number is 1520" is normalized to "Your account number is one five two zero".10  
* **Content Filtering**: Suppressing structural metadata.30 Markdown markers, image URLs, raw HTML, and complex terminal outputs are filtered out.10  
* **Alternative Presentation**: If the system must present dense multi-column tables, long bulleted lists, or sensitive personal data (such as passwords or full credit card numbers), the agent must redirect the content to a visual display or private text channel instead of reading it aloud.46

## **Text-to-Speech, Prosody, and Voice Behavior**

Text-to-Speech (TTS) models determine the vocal personality, warmth, and authority of the voice agent. Prosody (the rhythm, melody, and intonation of speech) carries emotional and syntactic weight, shaping user trust and understanding.10

### **TTS and Prosody Control Model**

To control synthetic voice output, the synthesis engine structures its commands using specialized parameters 10:

| Parameter Target | Control Value / Range | Algorithmic Mechanism | Target Output Behavior |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Voice Selection** | Approved brand voice profiles 27 | Neural speaker embedding mapping | Anchor brand personality.27 |
| **Speaking Rate** | 130 - 180 words/min 17 | Linear time-scaling DSP filters | Slow for numbers, fast for summaries.46 |
| **Pitch Contour** | -12 to +12 semitones 36 | F0 frequency-domain pitch shifting | Dynamic intonation peaks. |
| **Intonation Style** | Rising / Falling contours | Prosodic pitch trajectory modulation | Signal question vs firm statement.44 |
| **Pause Insertion** | 100 ms - 1200 ms 36 | Frame zero-padding injection 36 | Mimic breathing, separate sentences.36 |
| **Emphasis Index** | 1.0 to 1.5 scale factor | Dynamic amplitude & pitch scaling | Highlight critical dates or terms.25 |
| **Pronunciation** | Lexicon/IPA mappings 11 | Grapheme-to-phoneme override dictionaries | Prevent misreading industry jargon.11 |
| **Spelling Mode** | Character-by-character spelling 6 | Interleaved spelling character strings | Speak codes/names letter-by-letter.6 |
| **Chunking Logic** | Sentence boundary locks | Sentence-buffer tokenizer filters | Interruption-safe streaming audio. |
| **Emotional Tone** | empathetic, serious, excited 10 | Multi-style style-space embeddings 10 | Match caller sentiment.10 |
| **Multilingual Voice** | Native language profiles 11 | Dynamic cross-lingual phoneme sharing | Code-switch without accent drift.11 |
| **Audio Quality** | 24 kHz PCM mono 33 | High-fidelity sample rate rendering 33 | Studio clarity over WebRTC.34 |
| **Fallback Voice** | On-device SFSpeech synthesizers 36 | Dynamic on-client system switch | Retain function under network loss.36 |

### **Identity Transparency and Behavioral Boundaries**

Human-like synthetic voices can lead to overtrust, where users assume an agent has cognitive, emotional, or moral capabilities it does not possess.48 To maintain safety, systems must enforce **Identity Transparency Boundaries**:

* **Explicit Disclosure**: The agent must identify itself as an artificial system at the beginning of the interaction or whenever asked.  
* **Consent and Cloned Voices**: Voice cloning is prohibited unless the target individual has provided explicit, cryptographically verifiable authorization.27  
* **Public Impersonation Bans**: The system must block the synthesis of celebrity, public official, or unauthorized third-party voices, enforcing safety filters at the model level to reject unauthorized voice models.27

## **Interruption, Barge-In, and Cancellation**

A natural voice system must allow the user to interrupt the agent at any point during playback.5 If the user has to wait for the agent to finish reading a long response before they can correct an error, the interface becomes unusable.5

### **Interruption and Barge-In Model**

Managing interruption is difficult because the system must capture the user’s speech while playing its own audio through the device speakers. This creates acoustic echo: the assistant’s output enters the microphone and can be misclassified as user speech.

A production voice system therefore needs a hybrid client-server interruption pipeline.

```

1. **Acoustic Echo Cancellation:** The client or server uses the playback reference signal to suppress the assistant’s own voice from microphone input.
2. **Client-Side Edge VAD:** Lightweight local VAD detects likely human speech without waiting for network round-trip.
3. **Duration Guard:** The system requires sustained speech rather than a click, cough, breath, or room impulse.
4. **Immediate Local Mute:** Playback stops locally so the user experiences immediate interruption.
5. **Upstream Signaling:** A high-priority barge-in/truncate message is sent to the backend.
6. **Server Cancellation:** The dialogue coordinator halts streaming TTS and cancels or pauses LLM generation.
7. **Playhead Alignment:** The system maps interruption time to the text/audio segment already spoken.
8. **Recovery Classification:** The interruption is classified as correction, stop, new task, clarification, backchannel, ambient noise, assistant echo, or bystander speech.

### **Interruption Classification and Dialogue Recovery**

| Interruption Category | Audio/Text Pattern | Classification Marker | State Machine Action | Playback Recovery Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Correction** | “No, Tuesday.” | High-confidence correction of previous content. | Enter repair state and update target parameter. | Purge remaining audio and synthesize corrected path. |
| **Stop Request** | “Stop.” “Hold on.” | Critical intent classification. | Transition to paused state. | Stop audio and wait for next user instruction. |
| **New Task** | “Actually, book Wednesday.” | Intent shift from current response. | Cancel current response path and restart planning. | Drop remaining playback. |
| **Clarification** | “Wait, what?” | Question or confusion marker. | Enter repair/explanation state. | Stop or soften playback; provide shorter clarification. |
| **Backchannel** | “mm-hmm,” “okay,” brief acknowledgment. | Short duration, low semantic takeover intent. | Preserve assistant floor. | Continue playback. |
| **Ambient Noise** | Cough, click, door slam. | Low speech probability or no linguistic content. | Reject interruption. | Continue playback. |
| **Assistant Echo** | Assistant’s own audio leaks into microphone. | High correlation with playback reference. | Reject interruption. | Continue or unmute if muted speculatively. |
| **Bystander Speech** | Background voice not matching active speaker. | Diarization or speaker mismatch. | Ignore or suppress segment. | Continue playback unless safety policy requires pause. |

### **Interruption Classification and Dialogue Recovery**

Not all incoming speech during agent playback represents an intent to seize the conversational floor. The system must classify the interruption to determine the appropriate recovery state.

| Interruption Category | Audio/Text Pattern | Classification Marker | State Machine Action | Playback Recovery Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Correction** | "No, Tuesday." 1 | High confidence word mismatch | Rollback, load repair prompt | Purge audio buffer; synthesize alternate path.5 |
| **Stop Request** | "Stop.", "Hold on." 1 | Critical intent classification | Transition to **PAUSED** state | Cessation of all audio output; wait for new trigger.5 |
| **New Task** | "Actually, book Wednesday." | Semantic intent shift 1 | Purge current session cache | Terminate running model threads, start new execution.5 |
| **Clarification** | "Wait, what?" 1 | Question pattern detection | Transition to **REPAIR** state | Generate explanatory sidebar text immediately.25 |
| **Backchannel** | "mm-hmm", "okay" 1 | Short acoustic/duration signature | Ignore interruption; keep floor | Maintain current playback; do not halt audio buffer.1 |
| **Ambient Noise** | Cough, click, door slam, | Low speech probability from VAD | Reject classification 1 | Maintain current playback.1 |
| **Assistant Echo** | Agent's own words leaking | AEC linear filter correlation | Reject classification 35 | Unmute client playback if muted speculatively.34 |
| **Bystander Speech** | Multi-speaker chatter 3 | Diarization ID mismatch 3 | Ignore segment 3 | Maintain current playback.3 |

### **Cancellation Semantics**

When an interruption occurs, the dialogue coordinator must evaluate the state of pending tool calls:

* If the agent was interrupted while simply speaking, the system discards the remainder of the generated text and updates its context to reflect the user's interruption.5  
* If a tool call has been dispatched to the execution environment, the system must consult the tool contract.4 If the tool is **Idempotent / Read-Only** (e.g., a search query), the coordinator cancels the execution thread immediately.42 If the tool is **Non-Idempotent / Side-Effecting** (e.g., a financial ledger write or database insertion) and execution has already started, **the operation cannot be cancelled**.9 The system must allow the database transaction to resolve, capture the resulting state, and present a verbal status update to the user, ensuring the agent's spoken statements align with the database state.9

## **Conversational Repair and Misunderstanding Recovery**

Because acoustic environments are imperfect and spoken language is often ambiguous, speech systems will frequently mishear entities, names, numbers, or intents.26 A production-ready voice agent must be capable of identifying communication breakdowns and resolving them through conversational repair without forcing the user to repeat the entire interaction.7

### **Conversational Repair Framework**

Conversational analysis classifies repairs into two categories based on who initiates the process and who resolves the issue 8:

* **Self-Initiated Repair**: The speaker notices their own error and corrects it mid-sentence (e.g., "Please book the flight to London... sorry, I meant Paris").8  
* **Other-Initiated Repair**: The listener flags a comprehension breakdown and requests clarification.8

In human dialogue, these are managed using specific, structured patterns 25:

```
                  +-----------------------------------------+  
                  |      Comprehension / Confidence Gate    |  
                  +-----------------------------------------+  
                                       |  
                   ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐  
                   | (High Confidence) | (Low Confidence/  | (Ambiguous  
                   |                   |  Entity Error)    |  Resolution)  
                   v                   v                   v  
          +------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+  
          | Proceed to Turn  | | Explicit Request | | Restricted Offer |  
          | Completion       | | "Can you spell?" | | "Do you mean A?"   
          +------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+  
                                       |                   |  
                                       v                   v  
                               +---------------------------------------+  
                               |     Process User Correction / Response|  
                               +---------------------------------------+  
                                                   |  
                                                   v  
                               +---------------------------------------+  
                               |      Update Active Dialogue State     |  
                               +---------------------------------------+
```

To implement these repair dynamics, production architectures run three primary repair patterns based on confidence scoring and entity classification 25:

| Repair Modality | Triggering Condition | Algorithmic Mechanism | Verbal Prompts / Patterns | Escalation Threshold |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Confidence Clarification** | Overall STT confidence drops below threshold (0.50 - 0.70) 41 | Open request prompting for repetition | "I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?" 25 | Strike 1: Prompt again. Strike 2: Slow down output tempo.46 |
| **Explicit Readback** | Critical alphanumeric capture completed 6 | Repeat exact parameter with confirm request | "I heard your account number is four five six seven. Is that correct?" 9 | Target parameter rejection resets input field buffer.9 |
| **Spelling Mode** | Phonetic spelling mismatch on proper nouns 8 | Character-by-character grapheme collector | "Could you please spell your last name letter-by-letter?" 8 | Trigger automatic lookup matching phonetic dictionaries.11 |
| **Digit-by-Digit Mode** | Alphanumeric string segmentation fail 10 | Disfluent digit capture filter | "Please repeat the routing code, saying each number slowly and separately." | Limit field capture size, fallback to DTMF/Keypad.46 |
| **Entity Disambiguation** | Multiple phonetic matches detected 25 | Restricted binary selection offering | "Did you mean June twelfth or July twelfth?" 25 | Strike 3: Divert to human specialist queue. |
| **Paraphrase Confirmation** | Multi-step logical intent inferred | Semantic summarization comparison | "Just to make sure we're on the same page, you want me to transfer five hundred dollars to John?" 9 | Rejection restarts planning loop; does not execute tool.9 |

## **Voice-to-Action Gating**

When voice interfaces connect to agentic tools, speech uncertainty becomes execution risk. An unstable transcript, misheard entity, spoofed speaker, or ambiguous intent must never trigger a permanent mutation.

Voice-to-action gating binds every tool invocation to transcript finality, confidence, speaker/session authorization, action risk class, confirmation requirements, and post-action verification.

### **Action Risk Classes**

| Action Risk Class | Target Operations | Transcript Requirement | Confidence / Identity Requirement | Spoken Confirmation Policy | Execution Rule |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Read-Only / Public Informational** | Weather, public facts, general Q&A, non-sensitive lookup. | Final utterance preferred; stable partial may prefetch. | Normal session identity. | None. | Execute or prefetch when safe; speak result after observation. |
| **Read-Only / Private Data** | Account balances, order status, medical/financial status, private documents. | Final utterance. | Active user/session authorization; speaker check where required. | May require lightweight confirmation in public/noisy contexts. | Do not read sensitive details aloud if environment/privacy risk is high. |
| **Low-Risk Local Mutation** | Local checklist item, draft note, non-shared reminder. | Final utterance. | Sufficient entity confidence; active session. | Usually none or lightweight clarification. | Execute if reversible and target is unambiguous. |
| **Low-Impact External Action** | Drafting/sending low-risk team messages, non-sensitive scheduling, simple CRM notes. | Final utterance. | Entity confidence high; recipient/target verified. | Explicit intent confirmation when external recipient or time matters. | Prefer draft/review mode when ambiguity exists. |
| **Medium-Risk Mutation** | Calendar events with invitees, customer-visible updates, ticket routing, account preference changes. | Final utterance plus complete entities. | Speaker/session authorization and target validation. | Explicit readback of target and consequence. | Execute through tool contract; verify result before saying complete. |
| **High-Risk / Irreversible** | Payments, file deletion, legal commitments, production deploys, credential changes. | Final utterance plus explicit confirmation turn. | Strong identity, liveness/MFA where applicable. | Strict payload readback. | Execute only after confirmation; verify state before completion claim. |
| **Critical Mutation** | Large transfers/refunds, security access changes, destructive data operations. | Voice may register intent only. | Strong identity plus secondary authorization. | Dual control or out-of-band approval. | Voice alone cannot execute; route to approved workflow. |

### **Confirmation Policy Ladder**

| Confirmation Level | Example Prompt | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **None** | No confirmation. | Low-risk public read-only response. |
| **Lightweight Clarification** | “Do you mean the Chicago office?” | Ambiguous but low-risk target. |
| **Explicit Intent Confirmation** | “Do you want me to send that message?” | External but low-impact actions. |
| **Strict Payload Readback** | “Confirm: transfer five hundred dollars to John Smith ending in 4421?” | High-risk mutation. |
| **Dual Control / Out-of-Band Approval** | “I’ve prepared the request. It requires administrator approval before execution.” | Critical mutation. |

### **Transcript and Entity Stability Requirements**

| Speech Artifact | Safe Uses |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Volatile partial transcript** | UI captions, speculation, prewarming. |
| **Stable speculative transcript** | Read-only prefetch only; no user-visible claim. |
| **Locked segment** | Reasoning and low-risk planning. |
| **Utterance complete** | Read-only response and low-risk tool execution. |
| **Confirmed utterance** | Mutating or high-risk tool execution. |
| **Readback-approved payload** | High-risk action submission. |

### **Structured Planning and Control Policy**

To avoid executing tools on conversational filler, production voice agents should use a hidden structured planning/control layer before speech or action. This layer does not need to expose chain-of-thought. It emits compact control state that the orchestrator can validate.

Instead of treating the model’s hidden reasoning as an artifact, the system should require a structured action policy object:

```json
{
  "turn_id": "turn_1042",
  "detected_intent": "transfer_funds",
  "risk_class": "HIGH_RISK_IRREVERSIBLE",
  "transcript_state": "utterance_complete",
  "required_entities": {
    "amount": {
      "value": "500.00",
      "confidence": 0.99
    },
    "recipient": {
      "value": "John Smith ending 4421",
      "confidence": 0.97
    }
  },
  "required_confirmation": "strict_payload_readback",
  "allowed_next_action": "request_confirmation",
  "tool_execution_allowed": false
}
```

The control layer may classify the turn, detect missing entities, request confirmation, choose a safe response path, or route to repair. It should not be described as a production dependency on visible chain-of-thought tokens.

### **Voice Action Invariant**

```text
Partial speech may prepare.
Final speech may plan.
Confirmed speech may authorize.
Verified system state may complete.
```

## **Voice Identity, Consent, and Security**

Voice interaction surfaces are vulnerable to identity spoofing, biometric replication, replay attacks, bystander command injection, and unauthorized synthetic voice use. A robust real-time voice system must distinguish between:

* **speech recognition:** what was said
* **speaker recognition:** who said it
* **liveness detection:** whether the audio likely came from a live human source
* **authorization:** whether that speaker/session may perform the requested action
* **voice synthesis governance:** which voices may be generated and under what consent

Voice biometrics should be treated as one signal in a defense-in-depth system, not as a magical identity wand with a waveform moustache.

### **Biometric Security and Cloning Prevention**

As voice synthesis improves, recorded or generated speech can challenge legacy voice-biometric systems. Security architectures should combine several controls.

#### **1. Real-Time Liveness and Anti-Spoofing**

The system analyzes incoming audio for signs of replay, synthetic generation, codec artifacts, spectral inconsistencies, phase artifacts, and unnatural temporal dynamics. A suspicious result should not automatically prove fraud, but it should downgrade trust and require additional authentication.

Typical response:

```text
anti_spoofing_confidence low
  -> block high-risk voice execution
  -> require MFA or registered-device confirmation
  -> preserve trace for security review
```

#### **2. Synthetic Audio Watermark Detection**

Watermark detection can identify synthetic audio from cooperating generation systems that embed durable marks. It should be used when available, but it must not be treated as universal proof. Many synthetic or replayed attacks will not contain a recognizable watermark.

Watermark policy:

| Detection Result | System Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Known watermark detected** | Treat as synthetic or system-generated; block biometric authentication. |
| **No watermark detected** | Does not prove human origin. Continue with liveness, speaker verification, and MFA policy. |
| **Unknown watermark / uncertain signal** | Downgrade trust and route high-risk actions to stronger authentication. |

#### **3. Cryptographic Provenance for Generated Audio**

For generated outbound audio, systems can attach signed provenance metadata to session recordings, audio chunks, or completed media artifacts. In real-time streams, provenance is usually represented through signed session manifests, chunk hashes, or post-call artifacts rather than a single static file manifest.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| STREAMING AUDIO PROVENANCE MODEL
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| [ Generated Audio Chunks ]
|          |
|          v
| [ Chunk Hashes ]
|          |
|          v
| [ Session Manifest ]
|   model ID | voice profile ID | timestamp range | chunk hash chain
|          |
|          v
| [ Signature ]
|   KMS/HSM signing key | organization identity | policy assertions
|          |
|          v
| [ Replay / Audit Verification ]
|
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Provenance metadata can support audit, disclosure, and origin verification. It cannot prevent every downstream recording, remix, compression artifact, or unauthorized copy. Useful? Yes. Omnipotent? Alas, no.

### **Voice Identity and Consent Model**

| Governance Parameter | Operational Mechanism | Security Control | Target Boundary |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Speech vs Speaker Recognition** | Keep STT output separate from speaker-biometric verification. | Isolated pipelines and least-privilege feature storage. | Prevent transcript text from becoming identity proof. |
| **Synthetic Voice Disclosure** | Verbal disclosure, UI disclosure, metadata assertion, or policy-controlled session banner. | Signed session or media provenance where available. | Prevent user deception and overtrust. |
| **Consent and Licensing** | Store explicit authorization for cloned or licensed voices. | Consent records, access controls, revocation path, audit trail. | Prevent unauthorized voice replica creation. |
| **Anti-Spoofing Filters** | Liveness, replay detection, synthetic audio detection, and anomaly scoring. | MFA fallback and high-risk action blocking. | Prevent voice spoofing from triggering access. |
| **Watermark Handling** | Detect known synthetic watermarks in inbound audio; watermark outbound generated audio when feasible. | Detection logs and policy gates. | Identify cooperating synthetic sources and generated outputs. |
| **Biometric Privacy** | Avoid retaining raw audio unless required; store protected embeddings with retention limits. | Encryption, deletion policy, regional compliance controls. | Reduce biometric privacy exposure. |
| **Corporate Voice Governance** | Restrict brand voices to approved profiles and use cases. | RBAC, approval workflows, generation logs. | Prevent brand voice hijack or misuse. |
| **High-Risk Authorization** | Require more than voice for critical operations. | MFA, registered-device confirmation, human approval, dual control. | Prevent irreversible actions from relying on voice alone. |

### **Consent Rules for Synthetic Voice**

A production system should enforce:

* no unauthorized cloning of private individuals
* no impersonation of public figures, officials, employees, or customers without authorization
* revocable consent records for licensed voices
* visible or audible disclosure when appropriate
* audit logs for voice profile usage
* policy review for emotionally manipulative or deceptive voice behavior
* safety gates for voice profiles used in regulated or high-trust contexts

## **Accessibility and Inclusive Voice Interaction**

Voice-first design must never mean voice-only.46 While real-time speech interfaces provide unprecedented accessibility for individuals with visual or motor impairments, they introduce barriers for individuals with stutters, aphasia, dysarthria, or hearing impairments.46

### **Inclusive Design Adaptations**

To ensure universal accessibility, real-time voice architectures must integrate inclusive-speech layers:

```
                  +-----------------------------------------+  
                  |         Incoming User Audio             |  
                  +-----------------------------------------+  
                                       |  
                                       v  
                  +-----------------------------------------+  
                  |        Speech Classifier Mode           |  
                  +-----------------------------------------+  
                                       |  
                     ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┐  
                     | (Standard       | (Stutter /      | (Non-Verbal /  
                     |  Speech)        |  Dysarthria)    |  AAC Input)  
                     v                 v                 v  
          +------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+  
          | Standard VAD /   | | Extend Silence   | | Redirect to      |  
          | Fast Turn-Taking | | Hangover (1500ms)| | Text Chat /      |  
          | (400ms Silence)  | | Bypass Repeats   | | Visual UI Form   |   
          +------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+
```

* **Stutter-Aware Endpointing**: Users who stutter experience involuntary sound repetitions, prolongations, or silent blocks. Standard endpointing cutoffs will segment their sentences prematurely. The dialogue coordinator must detect repetitive syllable patterns or acoustic blocks and automatically extend the max silence threshold to 2500 ms - 4000 ms, preventing premature interruption and allowing the speaker to finish their thought at their own pace.  
* **Atypical Speech Models**: Classic STT decoders trained on standard pronunciation frequently misidentify slurred, strained, or atypically paced speech caused by dysarthria, cerebral palsy, or Parkinson's disease. Production pipelines route atypical audio through specialized speech recognition models (e.g., Voiceitt's atypical speech API) that adapt dynamically to individual vocal patterns, converting disjointed acoustics into clear, reconstructed text.  
* **Multimodal Fallbacks**: For hearing-impaired users or non-verbal individuals, the interface must present synchronized visual captions, interactive text-entry alternatives, and support for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device speech output. The system must allow users to transition between voice, touch, and text typing at any point during the session without losing conversation state or history.

### **Accessibility and Inclusive Voice Interaction Model**

Implementing accessible interfaces requires programmatic constraints to support diverse speech and language capabilities.46

| Target Disability Category | Specific Acoustic Challenge | Technical Mitigation Strategy | System Fallback Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Motor & Physical** | Inability to press physical keys or hold devices. | Native voice wake-word + local VAD processing.39 | Dynamic push-to-talk toggling.54 |
| **Low Vision / Blind** | Inability to inspect screens or visual cards.46 | Strict verbal descriptive summaries of visual state.46 | Screen-reader compliant LaTeX / HTML output. |
| **Dyslexia / Cognitive** | Working memory load limits on long spoken sentences.46 | Clamp speaking rate below 140 words/min.46 | Push persistent summary transcripts to the client visual display.46 |
| **Hearing Impairments** | Inability to hear synthesized audio output.46 | Stream real-time visual closed-caption arrays.46 | Full download of session text transcript.46 |
| **Stutter / Stammer** | Involuntary blocks, prolongations, repetitions.51 | Extended semantic VAD thresholds, ignore syllable loops. | Toggle conversational pace setting to "Slow".39 |
| **Dysarthria / Slurred** | Muscular weakness altering consonant articulation.46 | Specialized acoustic training adapters (Voiceitt databases).55 | Refine input via local LLM grammar reconstruction.47 |
| **Aphasia** | Long pauses, word-retrieval struggle, fragments.46 | Extend silence hangover to > 3.0 s dynamically.46 | Use predictive word bank suggestions on visual displays.46 |
| **Temporary / Environmental** | Noisy cafés, laryngitis, dental recovery.46 | Noise-aware filtering + WebRTC AGC adjustments.35 | Switch dynamically to non-verbal text-chat messaging.46 |

## **Voice Privacy and Environment Model**

Because speech is an active acoustic waveform projected into physical space, voice systems interact directly with the user’s social and environmental surroundings.28 The system must respect privacy boundaries and adapt to the context of the user’s immediate physical space.30

| Operational Environment | Privacy Hazard | Technical Defense Protocol | Fallback / Safe State |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Public Place / Transport** | Shoulder-surfing acoustics, bystander overhearing.19 | Private Content Filter: Restrict financial/personal parameter readbacks.46 | Dynamic redirect to private smartphone display cards.46 |
| **Noisy Home / Office** | Accidental capture of background conversations or television.2 | Neural speaker-separation + diarization classification.3 | Ignore audio frames mapping to non-primary diarization IDs.3 |
| **Shared Workplace** | Capturing private background speech from coworkers.36 | Local wake-word validation + near-field microphone limits.39 | Shut down media plane if signal-to-noise ratio drops below 10 dB. |
| **Static Secure Room** | Eavesdropping via always-listening cloud connections.36 | Hardware Push-to-Talk (PTT) / physical mute triggers.36 | Terminate media stream socket; run local-only VAD.34 |
| **Compliance Monitored** | Accidental capture of PCI/PHI metadata.36 | Real-time regex and entity redaction on STT pipeline. | Quarantine target transcript blocks; raise security flag. |

## **Realtime Voice Failure Mode Map**

Real-time voice systems are vulnerable to failure modes that do not exist in text-based environments.1 This failure mode map outlines the typical symptoms, underlying causes, and mitigation strategies for production-grade systems.4

| Failure Mode | User-Visible Symptom | Technical Root Cause | Detection Signal / Trigger Metric | Mitigation & Architectural Prevention |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **False Endpoint** | Agent cuts off the user mid-sentence or mid-thought, speaking over them.1 | Silence thresholds are too short or VAD registers silence during thoughtful pauses.1 | Post-interruption user correction rate / Overlap duration.1 | Deploy Hybrid Semantic-Acoustic VAD; extend pause thresholds on trailing conjunctions.20 |
| **Late Endpoint** | The agent takes 1.5 s - 2 s to respond, creating dead air.1 | Silence thresholds are set too high or wait for forced timeout.38 | Turn Latency / User repeat prompt rate.4 | Use punctuation-based turn detection or eager semantic classification.39 |
| **Clipped Speech** | The STT engine misses the last word of the user's sentence.1 | VAD closes the capture buffer immediately upon silence, chopping trailing phonemes.1 | Under-transcribed word error rate / Speech-stopped timestamp overlap. | Apply a minimum trailing padding (150 ms - 200 ms) after VAD silence detection.5 |
| **Overtalk / Overlap** | Both user and agent speak simultaneously, creating chaotic crosstalk.22 | State machine fails to yield floor or slow network delay.2 | Double-talk duration > 300 ms.2 | Calibrate WebRTC AEC3; enforce strict floor yield rules.5 |
| **Dead Air** | Conversation halts, neither party speaks, session feels broken.22 | Silence timeout fails to trigger or LLM reasoning hangs.4 | Continuous silence duration > 3.5 s.4 | Play comforting background hum or dispatch verbal status updates. |
| **False Barge-In** | Agent stops speaking prematurely on brief background noises (cough, click, door slam).5 | High-sensitivity VAD threshold with no duration guardrails.5 | Interruption rate / False interruption count.5 | Implement a minimum sustained-speech duration guard (150 ms - 250 ms) before triggering truncation.5 |
| **Missed Barge-In** | User says "stop" or "no", but the agent continues speaking over them.5 | Poor acoustic echo cancellation or high local client jitter buffer.5 | High overlap duration / User speech amplitude spike during output. | Calibrate WebRTC AEC3; implement immediate local speaker muting on client-side VAD speech onset.34 |
| **Echo Interruption** | The agent interrupts itself as soon as it begins speaking. | The agent's output leaks into the microphone and triggers the VAD.5 | Autocorrelation match between output and input streams.35 | Route speaker reference audio back to WebRTC AEC3; calibrate delay estimation parameters.35 |
| **Partial Action Mutation** | An API database change is executed on a sentence before it is finished.6 | Dialogue coordinator acts on an unstable partial transcript.6 | Database rollback count / API execution timestamp preceding speech_final.6 | Restrict mutation tool access to finalized, stable transcripts with explicit confirm gates. |
| **Transcript Revision** | The system processes a parameter (e.g., "$15" vs "$50") but the STT later revises the text after execution. | Over-optimistic parsing of interim results.6 | Post-execution revision count / Transcript mismatch rate.6 | Buffer state execution until is_final: true is returned by the decoder.6 |
| **Entity Miscapture** | The agent mishears proper nouns, names, or addresses, causing task failure.1 | Out-of-vocabulary phoneme mapping on specialized terms.11 | Downstream validation failures / Specific Entity WER.1 | Initialize STT connections with keyterm prompts and domain-specific pronunciation dictionaries.11 |
| **Wrong Speaker** | Commands from a background bystander are processed as user intent.3 | Lack of speaker diarization or biometric verification.3 | Speaker embedding distance > threshold on active turn.3 | Bind the active session context strictly to the authenticated user's voice footprint.3 |
| **Speaker Spoofing** | Unauthorized user gains access using a recorded or synthesized voice.27 | Vulnerable biometric voice verification system lacking anti-spoofing controls.27 | Verification security alert rate.27 | Run active liveness detection; verify synthetic watermarks on inputs; enforce multi-factor authentication.27 |
| **Accent Failure** | Accuracy drops dramatically for non-standard English accents.53 | Training data under-represents regional pronunciations.53 | Segment-level WER > 15% on accented accounts.53 | Implement multi-scale acoustic feature recalibration networks.43 |
| **Stutter Cutoff** | User with a stutter is cut off after repeating initial syllables.47 | Rapid syllable breaks are registered by VAD as silent turn-yielding pauses. | High session abandonment rate for accessibility segments.47 | Dynamically switch to the Inclusive/Accessibility profile; extend max turn silence.38 |
| **Noisy Room Fail** | System loops constantly, unable to process clean speech.36 | Environmental noise overrides energy thresholds.38 | Frame classification entropy > 0.8.38 | Calibrate adaptive noise filters; switch client settings to WebRTC level 3.35 |
| **Latency Cliff** | Conversations drop below human conversational pace (> 1.2 s).4 | Lack of stream-pipelining; slow model inference; geographic server-client distance.4 | End-to-End Latency distribution (P95 > 1000 ms).4 | Enforce concurrent sentence-buffered TTS streaming; peer transceivers close to major network hubs.30 |
| **TTS delay** | Long gap between LLM first token and audio playback onset. | Sentence buffer is set too large or TTS synthesis is too slow.4 | TTS Synthesis time-to-first-audio (TTFA) > 300 ms.4 | Utilize low-latency synthetic voices; stream first chunk before completing sentence.4 |
| **Streaming Contradiction** | Agent begins speaking a claim, then halts and corrects itself mid-sentence. | The streaming LLM changed its reasoning direction after partial tokens were already sent to synthesis. | Self-correction count in active speaker streams.8 | Implement a minimum lookahead token buffer before dispatching to TTS; enforce semantic sentence buffering.11 |
| **Tool Result Outrun** | Agent says "Your money has been sent" but the payment API fails 2 s later. | Claim generated before tool execution state was verified. | Claim-to-Reality validation failures. | Restrict vocalized completions until the execution engine returns a verified success payload.9 |
| **Under-Repair** | System repeatedly misinterprets input without launching clarification loops.8 | Lacks confidence threshold filters.1 | Repetitive intent correction loops.8 | Execute Targeted Restricted Requests on any entity confidence drops.25 |
| **Over-Confirmation** | Agent asks "Is that correct?" for basic, low-risk statements, frustrating the user.9 | Confirm gates applied globally without risk classification.9 | Task Completion Time (TCT) rises unnecessarily.2 | Align confirm prompts to action risk profiles.9 |
| **Creepy Voice** | User experiences discomfort or anxiety regarding the agent's emotional tone.48 | Excessive, inappropriate synthetic emotional matching or fake human claims.48 | Perceived creepy score in post-call evaluations. | Mandate identity transparency disclosures; clamp emotional synthesis parameters to appropriate ranges.48 |
| **Voice Impersonation** | Brand voice replica is compiled and posted to public domains.27 | Lack of server-side watermarking or signing.19 | Unauthorized brand asset detection alerts.48 | Embed permanent, spectral PerTH watermarks and C2PA manifests into all generated audio.19 |
| **Privacy Leak** | Agent reads highly private data aloud in a public, crowded space.1 | Failure to evaluate physical or environmental context. | Post-call privacy incident logs.1 | Restrict sensitive readbacks; redirect private parameters to visual display cards.46 |
| **Inaccessible Fallback** | Non-verbal user is locked out because the system requires voice confirmation. | System has no multimodal interfaces.46 | Accessibility failure report count.46 | Support parallel text typing, DTMF input, and non-voice alternatives.46 |

## **Evaluation and Observability**

A real-time voice system cannot be evaluated using offline Word Error Rate (WER) alone.1 While transcription accuracy is a key metric, the conversational success of an agent is determined by turn transitions, interruption responsiveness, and safety boundaries.5

### **Voice Evaluation and Observability Guidance**

Establishing continuous observability over live voice sessions requires tracking metrics across both the perception plane and the temporal interaction plane.1

| **System Security** | Privacy Incident Rate 1 | Public data leaks / bystander capture | 0 verified leaks under public context.1 |
| **Conversational** | Abandonment Rate 26 | Call drop during breakdown sequences | < 3.0% of active calling sessions.26 |
| **Conversational** | User Satisfaction (MOS) 44 | Perceived naturalness / helpfulness | Mean Opinion Score > 4.2 out of 5. |

## **Cross-Canon Handoff Map**

The systems architecture of AI-ENG-Q interfaces directly with upstream and downstream reports across the AI Systems Engineering Canon. Its durable handoff is temporal state preservation: audio frames, transcripts, speaker turns, interruptions, confirmations, tool gates, and spoken claims must remain traceable across the full interaction lifecycle.

| Target Report ID | Target Report Domain | Operational Handoff | Dependency / Engineering Integration Rule |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **AI-ENG-B** | Context Tenure & State Governance | Audio-frame retention, transcript tenure, speaker-state lifetime. | Apply memory-clearing and retention rules to raw audio, partial transcripts, finalized transcripts, and biometric features. |

| **AI-ENG-Y** | Human Review | Failed repair loops, biometric uncertainty, high-risk command escalation. | Divert to human operators when automated voice comprehension or authorization is insufficient. |
| **AI-ENG-Z** | Telemetry and Metrics | Voice onset, endpoint, STT finality, barge-in, TTFA, turn latency, repair rate. | Emit timestamped OpenTelemetry events for the full audio-to-action loop. |
| **AI-ENG-AA** | Speech & Voice Evaluations | Voice-agent benchmark traces, endpointing tests, barge-in tests, spoken-action safety suites. | Evaluate STT accuracy, turn-taking, interruption, repair, and action-gating behavior. |
| **AI-ENG-AB** | Audit and Replay | Audio-frame references, transcript revisions, spoken confirmations, session manifests. | Reconstruct the voice interaction from audio evidence, transcripts, timestamps, and policy decisions. |

The durable handoff is this:

```text
AI-ENG-Q exports temporal interaction state:
who spoke, what was heard, when it stabilized, how the floor changed,
what was confirmed, what action was gated, what was spoken,
and what evidence supports replay.
```

## **Durable Principles of Real-Time Interaction Systems**

### **1. Timing is Semantic Content**

In real-time voice, pauses, turn transitions, intonation, and response latency carry equal semantic weight to the textual tokens themselves.1 A real-time voice system must treat conversational pace as a first-class optimization metric.4

### **2. Stream-Pipelining is Non-Negotiable**

To operate within human turn-taking expectations (200 ms - 500 ms), a voice agent cannot run sequentially.22 Every stage of the pipeline—from client-side audio capture, streaming transcription, token generation, clause-boundary sentence buffering, to TTS synthesis—must execute concurrently and stream outputs continuously to the next stage.4

### **3. Silence is Not the Same as an Endpoint**

Energy-based silence detection fails in real-world environments.1 Highly accurate turn-taking requires a hybrid semantic-acoustic model that combines frame-level acoustic VAD with real-time evaluation of linguistic completeness, prosodic contours, and conversational filler tokens, ensuring users are never prematurely cut off mid-thought.1

### **4. Spoken Claims Must Never Outrun Verified Reality**

When a voice interface is connected to external systems, unconfirmed spoken statements can create false user expectations. All non-idempotent or high-impact actions must be validated, and their execution state verified, before the agent vocalizes completion, enforcing a strict confirm-gate on unstable transcripts.

### **5. Voice-First Must Never Mean Voice-Only**

Speech is biologically and socially variable.46 Real-time voice systems must incorporate inclusive-design adaptations to support speech differences (stutters, dysarthria, aphasia) and mandate alternative visual captions, manual touch fallbacks, and text alternative paths to ensure accessibility under all environmental and physical conditions.46
