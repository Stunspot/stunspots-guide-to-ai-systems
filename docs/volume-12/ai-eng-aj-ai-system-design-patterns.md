# AI-ENG-AJ — AI System Design Patterns - Reference Architectures & Failure-Aware Blueprints

## **Conceptual Glossary**

* **AI System Design Pattern**: A formalized, reusable template addressing a recurring coordination and execution challenge in non-deterministic computing environments. Unlike traditional software patterns that assume static control flows, an AI design pattern maps state transitions while managing the variability and latent risks of foundation model completions.1  
* **Reference Architecture**: A highly structured blueprint defining the canonical components, data flows, integration surfaces, and interface boundaries required to instantiate a specific class of AI system.3 It details both functional blocks and the exact contracts that isolate failures and enforce deterministic behavior at probabilistic boundaries.4  
* **Failure-Aware Blueprint**: An engineering specification that treats operational failure as a statistical certainty rather than an exceptional anomaly. It embeds detection, mitigation, containment, and recovery mechanisms directly into the system topology to ensure graceful degradation under failure states.4  
* **Pattern Card**: A standardized, multi-dimensional specification document used to evaluate, select, implement, and audit a specific AI system design pattern. It operates as the definitive schema of record for an architecture, establishing boundary conditions, testing obligations, and operational controls.  
* **No-Use Condition**: A set of technical, operational, or business constraints under which a specific AI design pattern must not be deployed. It defines the boundaries of the pattern's viability, routing architects to deterministic or non-AI alternatives when those boundaries are breached.  
* **Anti-Pattern**: A common, superficially attractive design choice or implementation shortcut that consistently yields systemic failures, uncontrollable costs, security vulnerabilities, or operational degradation in production environments.1  
* **Degraded Mode**: A predefined, safe, lower-capability operational state that a system autonomously or semi-autonomously downshifts into when its primary probabilistic pathways fail.4 It prioritizes structural safety, data integrity, and predictability over complete functionality.  
* **Contract Surface Map**: A multi-dimensional cross-reference index defining which structural contracts (such as schema, permission, prompt, and tool contracts) are mandatory, conditional, or optional across a portfolio portfolio of reference architectures.  
* **Eval-by-Pattern**: The systematic mapping of specialized, quantitative evaluation metrics (e.g., faithfulness, context precision, and tool-call validity) to specific system design patterns to validate execution safety and performance.7  
* **Telemetry-by-Pattern**: The prescriptive specification of the exact trace elements, telemetry attributes, and state variables that must be captured and logged for a given pattern to ensure comprehensive observability, auditing, and debugging.4  
* **Human Review Map**: A governance matrix specifying the precise interfaces, roles, and levels of authority reserved for human operators within agentic and semi-autonomous systems, calibrated against operational risk tiers.1  
* **Security Boundary Map**: A structural specification of the isolation zones, data egress controls, credentials access parameters, and sandboxing requirements across different patterns to defend against prompt injection, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.9  
* **Pattern Maturity**: A six-tier progression framework used to assess the readiness of an AI pattern implementation from initial local prototype (Level 0) to a highly platformized, automated golden path (Level 5).

## **AI Reference Architecture Doctrine**

The foundational thesis of high-dimensional AI engineering asserts that a reference architecture is not merely an illustrative collection of boxes and arrows; it is a decision artifact. A pattern is reusable only when its boundaries, assumptions, and breach behaviors are explicit. Probabilistic cores—such as large language and vision models—must be tightly surrounded by deterministic, typed, versioned, and observable edges. Consequently, an effective reference architecture must encode its contract surfaces, evaluation gates, failure modes, anti-patterns, operating controls, degraded modes, and no-use conditions directly into the structural design.  
Traditional systems engineering optimizes for deterministic reliability: inputs are transformed into outputs via known, verifiable code paths. In contrast, AI engineering systems govern probabilistic engines where identical inputs can yield divergent, semantic completions.1 This non-deterministic quality introduces systemic failure modes—including silent drift, tool-use parameter hallucination, cascade failures, and context attention dilution—which cannot be resolved by standard debugging paradigms.5  
To build production-grade systems, architects must apply the principles of contract-driven architecture. Every transition point between a deterministic service and a probabilistic model must be governed by an explicit contract stack, as established in the systemic canon. This stack spans user expectations, workflows, policies, prompts, retrievals, routes, schemas, tools, evaluations, deployments, and sourcing models. A design pattern represents the repeatable composition of these contracts to resolve a specific workload class. By structuring patterns as failure-aware blueprints, engineering teams can guarantee that when a probabilistic core fails to meet a contract, the surrounding deterministic architecture isolates the failure, records the complete trajectory, triggers appropriate recovery mechanisms, and downgrades the service controlledly.4

## **Pattern Card Template**

Every reference architecture in this doctrine is documented as a Pattern Card. A Pattern Card is not a decorative summary. It is the reusable architecture record for a workload class: when to use the pattern, when not to use it, what contracts are required, how it fails, how it degrades, how it is evaluated, and who remains accountable.

The Pattern Card is the handoff object between product architecture, engineering implementation, governance, evaluation, operations, adoption, and sourcing.

## **Architecture Pattern Taxonomy**

AI system patterns should be organized by workflow archetype, authority level, state mutation, evidence burden, and user-review structure. A taxonomy is useful only if it helps teams route a real requirement to the correct architecture and reject bad fits early.

### **Selection Rule**

If two patterns appear plausible, choose the one with less autonomy, clearer evidence, lower integration burden, and safer degraded mode. If the task can be solved cleanly without AI, that is not a failure of imagination. It is architecture doing its job.

## **Reference Blueprint Set**

The reference blueprint set defines reusable AI system patterns. Each pattern is expressed as a real Markdown card so it can be searched, indexed, diffed, linked, and reused by architecture teams.

| **Decision-Support Cockpit** | Evidence conflict, missing source, high uncertainty, route failure. | Static checklist and raw evidence packet. | Scenario synthesis/recommendation. | Require human decision; recover after evidence sufficiency. |
| **Background Classifier / Router** | Classifier drift, low confidence, queue route failure. | Manual triage queue or deterministic rules. | Automated routing. | Alert queue owner; recover after taxonomy/eval pass. |
| **Personal / Team Productivity Assistant** | Memory unsafe, context too sensitive, local route unavailable. | Standard editor/search without AI. | Memory use and generation. | Show AI unavailable/restricted; recover after policy/route pass. |
| **Governed Agentic Workflow** | Graph deadlock, contract breach, tool failure, resource budget. | Pause graph and checkpoint state. | Node advancement and side effects. | Notify process supervisor; recover by manual resume or rollback. |
| **AI Gateway / Control Plane** | Provider outage, policy failure, key compromise, routing anomaly. | Fail closed or use only approved fallback routes preserving contracts. | Unsafe provider routes and direct bypass. | Alert platform; recover after route/policy health check. |
| **Human Review Queue** | Reviewer overload, queue tooling failure, evidence missing. | Hold items in staging; pause downstream writes. | Approval/commit. | Notify operations; recover after queue capacity/evidence restored. |
| **Evaluation / Shadow Mode** | Shadow cost spike, candidate failure, data policy violation. | Disable candidate path; production path remains isolated. | Candidate evaluation traffic. | Alert release owner; recover after shadow policy/eval fix. |

A degraded mode is not “use a weaker model and hope.” It is a controlled reduction in capability that preserves safety, authority, and evidence boundaries.

## **AI Architecture Anti-Pattern Catalog**

### **Chatbox on Everything**

* **Symptoms**: A single, open-ended conversational chat input area is deployed as the primary user interface, replacing structured web forms, nested menus, action tables, and application buttons.  
* **Why Tempting**: Fast to build and deploy; simplifies UI design; shifts the burden of navigating process complexity directly to the user's phrasing.  
* **Why It Fails**: Increases cognitive load on users, who must guess which inputs are valid; leads to high task friction; and yields highly inconsistent completions where deterministic data writes are required.1  
* **Detection Signals**: Low user engagement metrics; high frequencies of multi-turn user explanation queries; user feedback complaining about lost dashboard features.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Use the Copilot pattern, embedding task-specific context suggestions inline within structured user interfaces with explicit, validated operation buttons.13

### **RAG-as-Database**

* **Symptoms**: A vector database and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline are utilized to perform precise, single-value transactional lookups (e.g., account balances, order status tracking, inventory quantities).  
* **Why Tempting**: Avoids the engineering effort of building relational database indexes or structured REST APIs, allowing developers to query un-parsed files directly via semantic similarity.  
* **Why It Fails**: Vector similarity models do not guarantee exact factual retrievals; models frequently miss target numbers or synthesize adjacent data fields.7  
* **Detection Signals**: Numeric errors in customer responses; low context precision metrics; database retrieval mismatches.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Use deterministic lookup paths (SQL indices, REST endpoints) for structured data queries, and reserve RAG patterns strictly for unstructured document search.

### **Agent as Intern with Admin Rights**

* **Symptoms**: An autonomous, model-driven agent is deployed to write directly to enterprise production systems of record (e.g., modifying ERPs, updating cloud server states) without sandbox boundaries or human approval gates.1  
* **Why Tempting**: Promises high automation speeds and creates the appearance of a fully automated operational process.  
* **Why It Fails**: Non-deterministic planner behaviors, tool call hallucinations, or prompt injections can trigger unauthorized database deletions, infinite transaction loops, and data corruption.1  
* **Detection Signals**: Corrupt production databases; billing anomalies; security alerts indicating unauthorized administrative API executions.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Deploy the Governed Agentic Workflow pattern with sandboxed transaction runtimes and strict human verification gates.1

### **Demo Architecture**

* **Symptoms**: A prototype pipeline using complex multi-agent frameworks is deployed to production with the same configurations used during local development, lacking telemetry logging, error routing, and tracing configurations.2  
* **Why Tempting**: Accelerates initial deployment schedules; minimizes system setup and platform management workloads.  
* **Why It Fails**: Production data exposes systemic anomalies, rate-limiting failures, token budget overruns, and security exploits that local testing environments hide.2  
* **Detection Signals**: Uncontrollable API spend; system timeout errors; untraceable transactional failures; lack of structured logging.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Implement the AI Gateway pattern to manage credentials, rate-limiting parameters, and open telemetry collections across providers.

### **Citation Theater**

* **Symptoms**: Generated documents feature academic-style footnotes and hyperlink annotations that point to irrelevant sources, hallucinated files, or non-existent document subsections.1  
* **Why Tempting**: Footnotes look professional and create the appearance of factual grounding and research reliability.  
* **Why It Fails**: Undermines system trust; users can be misled by plausible-sounding synthetic text backed by hallucinated references.1  
* **Detection Signals**: User feedback flagging broken links; low citation fidelity evaluation scores; automated grounding mismatches.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Deploy a dedicated Citation Verifier pipeline to validate visual coordinate maps and link offsets before rendering documents.

### **Workflow Double-Work**

* **Symptoms**: Users spend more time reviewing, correcting, and re-verifying model-generated drafts than they would have spent writing the document manually.  
* **Why Tempting**: Promises high-volume automated document drafts at low upfront cost.  
* **Why It Fails**: High-volume, low-quality generations introduce long correction workloads, causing operator fatigue and reducing productivity.  
* **Detection Signals**: High user reject rates; low adoption metrics; longer document processing timelines.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Deploy bounded Copilot models designed to suggest local completions inline, rather than generating entire complex reports at once.13

### **Model Leaderboard Architecture**

* **Symptoms**: Selecting a core model backend based purely on generic public benchmarks (e.g., MMLU scores) rather than evaluating performance against custom task data.  
* **Why Tempting**: Avoids the operational cost of building local evaluation test suites and benchmark datasets.  
* **Why It Fails**: Public benchmarks rarely reflect specific corporate task parameters, schema requirements, or document formatting realities.  
* **Detection Signals**: Upgraded models underperforming on custom corporate tasks despite higher public benchmark scores.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Build localized evaluation datasets and regression gates based on production telemetry to validate model upgrades.

### **Single-Provider Hardwire**

* **Symptoms**: Directly referencing vendor-specific SDK libraries and proprietary API payload formats throughout system controller files, without decoupling layers.  
* **Why Tempting**: Simplifies initial integration; leverages vendor-specific helper utilities.  
* **Why It Fails**: Locks the enterprise into a single model provider; introduces operational risk during outages or API deprecations.6  
* **Detection Signals**: Long refactoring timelines during model migration projects; systemic outages when a primary model provider experiences downtime.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Implement the AI Gateway pattern using standard API specifications to decouple application controllers from provider endpoints.9

### **Unbounded Research Goblin**

* **Symptoms**: Deploying research agents without step execution boundaries, model timeout constraints, or spending ceilings, allowing models to query APIs indefinitely in search of answers.1  
* **Why Tempting**: Promises deep, thorough research by allowing agents to search iteratively.1  
* **Why It Fails**: Stochastic loops can trigger hundreds of search queries and model calls, causing token costs to spike rapidly.1  
* **Detection Signals**: Cost alerts; model requests timing out; execution trace logs showing deep, circular reasoning trees.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Implement strict execution budgets, step limits, and timeout boundaries in agent planner configurations.1

### **Magic Document Reader**

* **Symptoms**: Multi-page, visually complex document folders (e.g., scanned PDFs with tables) are sent directly to models as raw file streams, relying on model context to interpret visual and spatial data.  
* **Why Tempting**: Avoids configuring specialized layout extraction tools and OCR parsers.  
* **Why It Fails**: Standard models frequently misinterpret multi-column tables, omit visual data, or confuse page-level spatial hierarchies.2  
* **Detection Signals**: Low extraction precision scores; misread data fields; hallucinated table summaries.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Implement a structured Document Intelligence Pipeline with layout parsing and spatial coordinate validation.2

### **One Pattern to Rule Them All**

* **Symptoms**: Attempting to use a single architectural pattern (e.g., an open-ended conversational agent) to handle all enterprise AI workloads.  
* **Why Tempting**: Standardizes development on a single framework, simplifying platform team operations.  
* **Why It Fails**: Different tasks have divergent constraints; forcing low-latency tasks through agent loops or highly structured extractions through chat interfaces degrades quality.  
* **Detection Signals**: Rising execution latency; user friction; high development costs as teams patch a monolithic system.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Select specialized reference patterns matched to the constraints of each task class.14

### **Gateway Bypass**

* **Symptoms**: Product development teams bypass central AI Gateways and deploy custom model endpoints directly using local cloud credentials.  
* **Why Tempting**: Allows developers to prototype and deploy changes without coordination bottlenecks with platform engineering teams.  
* **Why It Fails**: Bypasses corporate security, access controls, token spending audits, and threat detection systems, introducing compliance risks.  
* **Detection Signals**: Hidden API cost increases on cloud billing; security audits finding unmonitored external model traffic.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Implement the AI Gateway pattern as a mandatory routing policy at the network boundary.

### **Fake Human-in-the-Loop**

* **Symptoms**: Human review interfaces are designed as simple confirmation panels with no access to grounding data or verification tools, encouraging rapid clicking.  
* **Why Tempting**: Minimizes workflow delay and reduces human labor costs while claiming safety compliance.  
* **Why It Fails**: Humans cannot verify claims without grounding data, leading to automated rubber-stamping and un-vetted errors reaching production.13  
* **Detection Signals**: 100% manual review approval rates; downstream error occurrences matching automated prototype testing rates.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Implement a dedicated Human Review and Escalation Queue with side-by-side evidence, coordinate highlighting, and rejection tools.

### **Deflection Theater**

* **Symptoms**: Customer support systems are configured to deflect user requests at all costs, blocking access to human agents or escalation queues.  
* **Why Tempting**: Minimizes customer support center staffing requirements and operational overhead.  
* **Why It Fails**: Traps users in unresolved loops with incorrect answers, leading to customer churn and brand damage.  
* **Detection Signals**: High customer exit rates; negative post-chat feedback ratings; rising repeat-contact frequencies.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Support Assistant pattern with structured intent classification and low-friction human escalation paths.

### **Metric Hallucination**

* **Symptoms**: Models generate business intelligence analytics directly against database tables without using standard, governed semantic metric layer definitions.  
* **Why Tempting**: Fast to deploy; avoids the engineering effort of building metadata frameworks or semantic layers.  
* **Why It Fails**: Models hallucinate database join paths, use non-standard calculation logic, or expose restricted records to unauthorized users.  
* **Detection Signals**: Inconsistent business metrics across reports; SQL compilation failures; security policy alerts.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Implement the Analytics Assistant pattern with strict SQL validators and a governed semantic metric layer.

### **Vector Dump Knowledge System**

* **Symptoms**: Thousands of un-curated, multi-format documents are uploaded into a single vector index without metadata, access rules, or lifecycle curation.8  
* **Why Tempting**: Extremely low configuration cost; provides generic conversational answers across the corpus.  
* **Why It Fails**: Returns outdated, duplicate, or conflicting context chunks, causing model synthesis confusion and access control leaks.  
* **Detection Signals**: Stale information in answers; high rate of irrelevant citations; unauthorized access to sensitive files.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Enterprise Knowledge System pattern with ingestion filters, dynamic chunking, and IAM integration.8

### **Auto-Merge Coding Agent**

* **Symptoms**: Automated coding tools are configured to commit code patches directly to production branches without developer review or verification testing.1  
* **Why Tempting**: Accelerates feature delivery; minimizes developer review overhead.  
* **Why It Fails**: Plausible but broken patches, logic errors, or security vulnerabilities are deployed directly to production systems.1  
* **Detection Signals**: Rising production regressions; build breakages; automated security alert spikes.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Enforce sandbox testing and manual peer-developer code reviews for all model-generated patches.

### **Fallback Contract Downgrade**

* **Symptoms**: When a primary, secure model provider fails, the system automatically redirects traffic to a simpler backup model while bypassing security, output validation, or policy contracts.  
* **Why Tempting**: Prioritizes system availability during primary provider outages.  
* **Why It Fails**: Lowers system security, allows unsafe outputs to bypass filters, and risks deploying unvalidated data.  
* **Detection Signals**: Security anomalies during primary provider outages; format validation failures on backup routes.  
* **Safer Alternatives**: Fallback configurations must enforce identical security, validation, and policy contracts across all model routes.

## **No-Use Condition Matrix**

No-use conditions prevent pattern overreach. They do not always mean “never use AI”; they often mean “use another pattern,” “add a human gate,” “use deterministic software,” or “complete readiness work first.”

| Pattern | No-Use / Redesign Condition | Why This Pattern Fails | Safer Architecture |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Copilot / Embedded Assistant** | Task requires autonomous execution, exact calculation, or unattended batch processing. | Inline suggestion surface does not provide execution assurance. | Deterministic workflow, analytics assistant, or workflow automation with gates. |
| **Research Agent** | User needs exact source-of-record lookup or answer must be instant and deterministic. | Multi-hop synthesis adds latency and hallucination risk. | SQL/API lookup, enterprise search, or deterministic report. |
| **Support Assistant** | Emergency, legal, medical, abuse, or high-emotion dispute without human escalation. | AI may delay proper human intervention. | Human-first support queue with AI evidence assist only. |
| **Document Intelligence Pipeline** | Source system already provides clean structured data. | OCR/extraction adds unnecessary error and cost. | API ingestion or deterministic parser. |
| **Workflow Automation Agent** | Irreversible or high-value mutation lacks approval, idempotency, or verification. | Side effects can be wrong and unrecoverable. | Human approval queue plus deterministic execution. |
| **Coding Agent** | Codebase cannot be built, tested, sandboxed, or reviewed. | No reliable validation path. | Human developer workflow; build test infrastructure first. |
| **Analytics Assistant** | Metrics are undefined, database access is broad, or output is regulated filing. | Model may invent joins/calculations. | Semantic metric layer, governed BI, deterministic reporting. |
| **Multimodal Review System** | Safety-critical diagnosis or measurement lacks regulated validation and expert authority. | False negatives/positives can cause harm. | Expert-led review with AI as evidence-prep only. |
| **Enterprise Knowledge System** | Corpus lacks ACLs, freshness, ownership, or lifecycle governance. | Retrieval can leak data or surface stale/conflicting answers. | Corpus engineering and permission indexing first. |
| **Decision-Support Cockpit** | Organization wants AI to make final high-impact decisions. | Cockpit pattern supports humans; it does not replace authority. | Manual decision workflow with evidence support. |
| **Background Classifier / Router** | False negatives have high consequence and no exception review exists. | Silent misrouting becomes systemic risk. | Manual triage or deterministic rules until eval/review exists. |
| **Productivity Assistant** | System manipulates records, sends customer messages, or processes regulated data. | Local assistant lacks governance and action controls. | Support assistant, workflow automation, or governed enterprise system. |
| **Governed Agentic Workflow** | Workflow is simple, linear, deterministic, or latency-critical. | Agent graph adds unnecessary complexity and cost. | Static workflow engine or deterministic microservice. |
| **AI Gateway / Control Plane** | One-off local toy prototype with no enterprise data or shared use. | Gateway overhead may exceed value. | Direct sandbox SDK with test credentials only. |
| **Human Review Queue** | Task is low-risk, high-volume, and deterministically validated. | Review creates bottleneck and fatigue. | Automated validation with sampled audit. |
| **Evaluation / Shadow Mode** | Production data cannot be mirrored safely or no evaluation metric exists. | Shadow path creates privacy risk or meaningless scores. | Offline eval with sanitized/representative data. |

If the no-use condition is true, do not “prompt harder.” Change the architecture.

## **Implementation Maturity Levels**

AI architecture maturity describes how safely and repeatably a pattern can be operated. Maturity is not model quality. It is the presence of contracts, evals, telemetry, security, human authority, operations, support, and lifecycle controls.

| Level | Name | Allowed Use | Forbidden Use | Required Controls | Exit Gate to Next Level |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0** | **Demo** | Local exploration with synthetic or non-sensitive data. | Production data, customer exposure, system-of-record access, unmanaged secrets. | Sandbox only, test credentials, no live integrations, no claims of reliability. | Define use case, data class, owner, and prototype boundary. |
| **1** | **Controlled Prototype** | Internal prototype with curated data and limited users. | Production actions, broad rollout, sensitive data without approval. | Basic prompt/schema, sandbox, initial evals, test keys/vaulted secrets, trace capture. | Pass seed eval, security/data review, and product-fit review. |
| **2** | **Pilot** | Bounded real workflow with limited users and explicit monitoring. | Autonomous high-impact actions, unreviewed external outputs. | Named owner, telemetry, human review path, fallback, incident contact, pilot success criteria. | Demonstrate quality, adoption, cost, safety, and operational readiness. |
| **3** | **Production** | Approved production workflow within defined risk tier. | Unbounded route changes, silent model swaps, missing rollback. | Contract stack, eval gate, deployment manifest, observability, runbook, rollback, support. | Prove repeatability across teams/routes and governance review. |
| **4** | **Governed Scale** | Multi-team or high-volume production under platform controls. | Pattern-specific one-off exceptions without review. | Gateway/control plane, standardized evals, policy automation, cost controls, audit evidence, adoption support. | Package as reusable golden path. |
| **5** | **Platform Golden Path** | Reusable pattern available through developer platform templates. | Bypassing mandatory controls. | Automated scaffolding, contract templates, eval harness, observability, security defaults, documentation, support model. | Continuous lifecycle; no higher maturity required. |

### **Maturity Rules**

| Rule | Meaning |
| :---- | :---- |
| **No production without owner.** | Every deployed pattern needs accountable product, technical, and operational ownership. |
| **No write authority before action verification.** | Tools that mutate state require permission, idempotency, and postcondition checks. |
| **No broad rollout without telemetry.** | Adoption, quality, cost, latency, and breach events must be visible. |
| **No model migration without eval evidence.** | Provider/model/prompt/schema changes are deployment events. |
| **No human review theater.** | Reviewers need evidence, veto power, and time. |
| **No prototype secrets sprawl.** | Even demos use test credentials and safe environments. |
| **No golden path without exit path.** | Reusable patterns must include sourcing and migration assumptions. |

Maturity is not achieved when the demo works. Maturity begins when failure is boring, bounded, and recoverable.

## **Cross-Canon Handoff Map**

AI-ENG-AJ converts the AI Engineering Systems Canon into reusable reference architectures. Earlier reports define the doctrine, constraints, controls, and failure modes. AJ packages them into pattern cards that teams can select, instantiate, evaluate, operate, and govern.

### **MCP and Tooling Note**

Tooling standards should be referenced carefully. MCP uses JSON-RPC messages over stdio and Streamable HTTP; SSE may be used within Streamable HTTP where supported. Architecture cards should describe the tool contract and transport requirements generically, then name MCP or other protocols as implementation options rather than hard dependencies.

### **Core Handoff Rule**

AJ is where doctrine becomes reusable architecture.

```text
A reference architecture is a reusable failure-aware contract bundle.

It tells engineers:
  when to use the pattern,
  when not to use it,
  what contracts are required,
  how it is evaluated,
  what telemetry proves,
  how humans retain authority,
  how it degrades,
  how it exits,
  and how it fails safely.
```
