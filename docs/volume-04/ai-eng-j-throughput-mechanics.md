# AI-ENG-J — Throughput Mechanics - Memory Pressure, KV Cache, and Hardware Realities

Serving machine learning outputs under production-scale workload pressure is fundamentally a physical transport discipline. In the execution of transformer-based architectures, model intelligence is bound by memory movement before computation.1 Every inference request—encompassing input prompts, retrieved context, dynamic tool definitions, active session states, and generated tokens—is a physical memory allocation that competes for finite high-bandwidth memory (HBM), local cache lines, interconnect routing capacity, and clock cycles.1  
The critical inquiry for the platform architect is not the abstract speed of a model on synthetic benchmarks, but rather the volume of useful inference the system can deliver per unit time, per unit memory, and per unit cost.1 This capacity is defined against a highly heterogeneous, stochastic distribution of input lengths, context payloads, output requirements, concurrency spikes, cache hit rates, and latency service level objectives (SLOs).  
Throughput is governed by memory movement before model intelligence. Inference capacity is constrained by how prompts, contexts, KV cache, batches, generated tokens, and serving schedulers occupy and move through hardware under load.

## **Conceptual Glossary**

To ground high-dimensional AI system architecture in physical realities, the following taxonomy establishes the structural, computational, and memory management vocabulary utilized across the runtime domain:

| Term | Domain | Definition | Systemic Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Throughput Mechanics** | Systems Execution | The physical science of serving useful model outputs under workload pressure by optimizing memory bandwidth, cache allocations, and scheduling policies.1 | Establishes throughput as a hardware-constrained execution process rather than an abstract mathematical call.1 |
| **Prefill Phase** | Compute Kernels | The initial forward pass of inference where the model processes all input prompt tokens simultaneously to build the initial KV cache.2 | Highly parallel and compute-bound; dominates the user-facing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT).2 |
| **Decode Phase** | Compute Kernels | The subsequent autoregressive phase where the model generates output tokens sequentially, one token per forward pass iteration.2 | Memory-bandwidth-bound; dominates the generation rate and Inter-Token Latency (ITL).2 |
| **Time-to-First-Token (TTFT)** | Latency Metrics | The elapsed duration between the physical ingestion of a request and the delivery of the first generated token to the client.2 | Primarily determined by queue wait times, context tokenization, and prefill phase execution speed.2 |
| **Inter-Token Latency (ITL)** | Latency Metrics | The time elapsed between the emission of successive output tokens during the autoregressive decode phase.2 | Governed by effective memory bandwidth and active concurrent batch memory footprint sizes.1 |
| **Key-Value (KV) Cache** | VRAM Allocation | The saved tensor activations of key and value states for past tokens across all attention layers, preventing redundant recalculation.6 | The primary dynamic driver of GPU memory pressure under concurrent serving loads.1 |
| **Context Window** | Model Specs | The maximum sequence length (input plus output tokens) that a model is mathematically configured to process in a single invocation. | Differs drastically from the *sustainable context window* supported under concurrent production batch loads.1 |
| **Paged Attention** | Virtual Memory | An attention-kernel memory allocation strategy that partitions the KV cache into fixed-size physical blocks scattered non-contiguously in VRAM.6 | Minimizes internal and external fragmentation to near-zero, enabling dynamic allocation and copy-on-write sharing.6 |
| **Continuous Batching** | Scheduler Policy | Iteration-level scheduling that allows requests to join and exit the execution batch at individual token boundaries.5 | Eliminates padding waste and dramatically scales GPU utilization compared to static or dynamic batching.5 |
| **Queue Depth** | Queueing Theory | The total number of pending inference requests waiting in the ingestion buffer to be admitted to the scheduler.5 | Directly impacts TTFT and dictates system stability boundaries under stochastic arrival spikes.3 |
| **Backpressure** | Flow Control | Traffic-throttling mechanisms that reject, delay, or route incoming requests when queue depths or memory utilization exceed capacity limits. | Prevents system collapse and cascading out-of-memory (OOM) failures under extreme demand burstiness.12 |
| **Prompt Caching** | Cache Architecture | Storing pre-computed KV states of stable, identical prompt segments (e.g., system instructions) in memory to bypass prefill compute.8 | Drastically reduces TTFT for applications with highly structured or repetitive inputs.8 |
| **Semantic Caching** | Cache Architecture | Caching complete natural language answers indexed by the semantic similarity of incoming queries to historic requests.15 | Eliminates full model evaluation for identical intents, but carries correctness, fresh-state, and permission risks.16 |
| **Prefix Reuse** | Cache Architecture | Reusing computed attention blocks of shared prefix strings (e.g., tool definitions) across multiple concurrent request paths.8 | Key mechanical benefit of SGLang's RadixAttention trie system.8 |
| **High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM)** | GPU Architecture | Co-packaged, ultra-wide-bus memory stacked directly on the GPU substrate to deliver massive data throughput.1 | The foundational physical factor constraining decode-phase speeds and sequence concurrency.1 |
| **Video Random Access Memory (VRAM)** | GPU Architecture | The aggregate physical memory pool directly addressable by the GPU, comprising high-speed HBM or GDDR modules.1 | Divided strictly between model weight parameters, runtime contexts, CUDA graphs, and the dynamic KV cache pool.1 |
| **Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)** | Host Architecture | Standard system RAM residing on the host motherboard, accessible to the GPU over the PCIe system bus.9 | Serves as the backup swap tier for evicted KV cache blocks under extreme memory pressure.6 |
| **Memory Bandwidth** | Data Transport | The rate at which data can be read from or written to physical storage by a processor, measured in Terabytes per second (TB/s).1 | The physical bottleneck governing decode performance; scales directly with GPU generational upgrades.1 |
| **Offloading** | Memory Management | The process of transferring inactive KV cache blocks or model weights from GPU VRAM to system DRAM or SSD storage.9 | Enables execution of ultra-large contexts or batches but introduces severe transfer-latency penalties over PCIe.9 |
| **Capacity Margin** | Capacity Sizing | The reserved physical compute, memory, and bandwidth headroom kept unallocated to absorb stochastic workload bursts and failovers. | Crucial for preventing preemption loops, cache thrashing, and SLA violations under dynamic production loads.3 |

## **The Physical Inference Lifecycle**

An incoming production request moves through a sequence of hardware-constrained state transitions. In typical multi-tenant, high-throughput engines, every step of this journey is governed by memory allocation budgets, metadata lookups, and hardware-level synchronization.

## **Prefill, Decode, and Latency Anatomy**

The asymmetric execution profiles of the prefill and decode phases dictate distinct system bottlenecks and tuning parameters.2 During the prefill phase, all N_in prompt tokens are evaluated in parallel.2 This multi-token execution permits substantial matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) parallelization, which exposes high arithmetic intensity—the ratio of floating-point computations executed per byte of memory read.1  
Because the arithmetic intensity of prefill operations sits well to the right of the hardware ridge point (e.g., 591 FLOPs/Byte on an NVIDIA H100 SXM5), the execution is strictly **compute-bound**.1 The limiting physical factor is the total floating-point throughput (FLOPS) of the GPU's Tensor Cores.1 Consequently, scaling compute capacity directly compresses TTFT.1

                                                 Workload Size
```

During the decode phase, the computational workload transitions from a matrix-matrix structure to sequential vector-matrix multiplications (GEMV).4 At each autoregressive iteration, the model must read all parameters (weights) and the entire, growing KV cache history of the sequence from high-bandwidth memory to process a single query token.1  
Because this movement involves transferring tens of gigabytes of data to perform a fraction of the computational math, the arithmetic intensity plummets to a range of 1 to 10 FLOPs/Byte.2 This places execution firmly in a **memory-bound** regime under the slanted roofline.1  
In this state, Tensor Cores sit underutilized, frequently stalled while waiting for memory controllers to stream data from HBM.2 Adding raw FLOP capacity does not improve decode-stage speeds; inter-token latency is directly governed by effective memory bandwidth (beta).1

### **Mathematical Prefill/Decode Cost Model**

Let a transformer model be parameterized by parameter count P, layer count L, key-value head count H_kv, head dimension d, and numerical representation precision b in bytes.1 For a given execution batch B, let the input prompt length be N_in and the active sequence context length be N_context.1  
The memory footprint of the model weights is defined by:  
M_weights = P * b  
At a single decode iteration step, the system must stream the model weights and the active KV cache pool across the memory bus.1 The aggregate data transfer volume per decode step (M_step) is modeled as:  
M_step = M_weights + (2 * B * L * H_kv * d * N_context * b) 1  
Under memory-bandwidth-bound constraints, the physical latency of a single decode iteration step (t_step) is limited by the effective memory bandwidth of the hardware (beta_effective):  
t_step ~ M_step / beta_effective = (P * b + 2 * B * L * H_kv * d * N_context * b) / beta_effective 1  
To account for scheduler overhead, network latency, and queueing delays under production workloads, the user-facing latency metrics of Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and Inter-Token Latency (ITL) are defined by the following formulations:  
TTFT(r) = W_queue(r) + t_tokenize(r) + (ceiling(N_in / C_chunk) * t_prefill_step(B, C_chunk)) + t_network 5  
ITL(r) = t_decode_step(B_active, N_mean_context) + t_network_delta 11  
Total Latency(r) = TTFT(r) + sum_{i=1}^{N_out-1} ITL_i(r) 11  
Where C_chunk is the maximum chunked prefill size limit configured in the scheduler.8 This parameter prevents large input prompts from blocking the batch scheduler and causing severe latency spikes for concurrent decode sequences.8

### **Latency Budget Profiles**

Because workloads differ in their latency tolerance and user experience constraints, systems must be configured to prioritize different optimization targets:

| Workload Class | Target TTFT SLO | Target ITL SLO | Primary Bottleneck | Optimal Tuning Profile |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Real-Time Interactive** (e.g., Voice Bots, Autocomplete) | < 150 ms | < 15 ms | Prefill initialization speed; immediate thread scheduling.2 | Minimize chunked prefill sizes; isolate batch lanes; provision dedicated GPU replicas.5 |
| **Interactive Chat** (e.g., Customer Service, Co-pilots) | < 400 ms | < 30 ms | Queue wait time; decode bandwidth under high concurrency.1 | Enable RadixAttention prefix caching; utilize continuous batching; enforce dynamic batching caps.8 |
| **Agent Tool Loops** (e.g., Multi-Step Reasoners) | < 100 ms | < 20 ms | Multiple sequential round-trips; tool schema prefill overhead.8 | Prioritize RadixAttention prefix caching for tool schemas; locate tool structures at prompt root.8 |
| **Document Analysis** (e.g., Legal PDF Summarizers) | < 1500 ms | < 50 ms | Massive prefill compute over long sequences; memory pressure.2 | Enable chunked prefill; utilize FP8 KV cache formats; scale HBM capacity horizontally.1 |
| **Batch Processing** (e.g., Offline Extractions) | < 10000 ms | < 100 ms | Raw aggregate token throughput; physical memory saturation limits.5 | Maximize concurrency limits; disable chunked prefill; use maximum static memory allocations.8 |

## **KV Cache: The Hidden Capacity Governor**

While model weights require a static allocation in VRAM, the Key-Value (KV) cache is highly dynamic, scaling directly with sequence length, output length, and concurrent request volume. During autoregressive generation, the attention mechanism requires access to the computed key and value states of all previous tokens in the sequence. To avoid recomputing these projections at every generation step, the serving runtime persists them in GPU memory.

The physical memory footprint `V_kv` occupied by the KV cache for a single sequence of context length `N_context` is calculated as:

`V_kv = 2 * L * H_kv * d * N_context * b`

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `2` | Separate storage for key and value tensors. |
| `L` | Transformer layer count. |
| `H_kv` | Number of key-value heads. |
| `d` | Head dimension. |
| `N_context` | Active context length in tokens, including prompt and generated tokens. |
| `b` | Bytes per KV element, such as `2` for BF16/FP16 or `1` for FP8. |

For a concrete demonstration, consider a Llama-class 70B model served with FP8 KV cache precision (`b = 1`) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). The architectural parameters are:

* Layer count: `L = 80`
* KV head count: `H_kv = 8`
* Head dimension: `d = 128`

For a single sequence of 16,384 context tokens:

`V_kv_16K = 2 * 80 * 8 * 128 * 16,384 * 1`

`V_kv_16K = 2,684,354,560 bytes`

This is approximately:

* `2.68 GB` in decimal units
* `2.50 GiB` in binary units

At a target serving concurrency of `B = 16` active requests with the same context length:

`V_kv_fleet = 16 * 2.50 GiB = 40.0 GiB`

This is the dynamic KV-cache footprint alone. It does not include model weights, activations, CUDA graphs, adapter memory, allocator metadata, fragmentation margin, or serving-engine overhead.

If the same model used standard multi-head attention (MHA) with `H_kv = H_query = 64`, the KV-cache footprint would scale by a factor of eight:

`V_kv_16K_MHA = 8 * 2.50 GiB = 20.0 GiB per sequence`

At `B = 16` concurrent requests:

`V_kv_fleet_MHA = 16 * 20.0 GiB = 320.0 GiB`

This illustrates why GQA and MQA are central to modern inference economics. They do not merely improve elegance on a model card; they directly reduce dynamic memory pressure under concurrent serving loads.

Historically, serving frameworks allocated contiguous physical memory for each request according to the maximum possible context window. This naive strategy created three severe forms of waste:

1. **Internal Fragmentation**: Memory is allocated in larger chunks than the sequence actually uses. If a block reserves space for 2,048 tokens but the request ends after 300 tokens, the unused allocation remains unavailable to other requests.

2. **Reservation Waste**: Memory is reserved for future tokens that may never be generated. A sequence currently at token 100 may hold capacity for thousands of possible future tokens.

3. **External Fragmentation**: Non-contiguous gaps form as requests of different lengths are admitted, completed, and evicted. A new request can fail to initialize even when the total free memory is sufficient, because the free space is scattered across incompatible physical gaps.

Under contiguous allocation schemes, practical GPU memory utilization can fall dramatically below physical capacity. PagedAttention and related cache-virtualization methods solve this by dividing the KV cache into fixed-size physical blocks and mapping logical token positions onto non-contiguous memory pages.

## **Paged Attention, Cache Virtualization, and Eviction**

To reclaim fragmented memory, modern serving runtimes employ cache virtualization.7 Inspired by virtual memory page tables in classical operating systems, PagedAttention decouples the logical sequence of a request's KV cache from its physical placement in HBM.6  
The physical HBM reserved for KV cache is partitioned into a global pool of fixed-sized physical blocks.6 Each block contains KV projections for a small, fixed number of tokens, typically designated as a block size of B_size = 16 or 32 tokens.7  
When a request arrives, its logical sequence of tokens is divided into logical blocks.6 The scheduler's memory manager maps these logical blocks to non-contiguous physical blocks anywhere in the global pool, maintaining this mapping inside a sequence-specific block table.6

|       -> physical_block   = block_table[logical_block_id]
|       -> address          = physical_block.base + offset
|
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Result:
|   Sequence A remains logically contiguous even though its KV blocks are
|   physically scattered across HBM. This eliminates most external fragmentation
|   and bounds internal waste to the final partially filled block.
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

During attention execution, the CUDA attention kernel is modified to perform dynamic gather operations.6 Instead of reading a single continuous memory stride, the kernel resolves physical memory addresses on the fly 6:  
Logical Block Index (idx_block) = floor(i / B_size) 6  
Offset within Block (offset) = i % B_size 6  
address = physical_block.base + offset * kv_token_stride.
This indirection introduces a negligible overhead of a single memory lookup per block but reduces KV cache memory waste to less than 4% by eliminating external fragmentation and restricting internal fragmentation to the final block of a sequence.6

### **Sequence Scheduler Mechanics**

At every single forward pass (iteration-level execution), the scheduler must evaluate the state of the physical block pool to determine if the active batch can proceed.6 Due to the autoregressive nature of decoding, every running sequence requires an additional token allocation at each step.10 If a sequence crosses a block boundary (i.e., N_seq_len % B_size == 1), the scheduler must allocate a new physical block from the free queue.27  
If the free block queue is depleted and cannot satisfy the allocation demands of the active batch, the system faces an out-of-memory (OOM) condition.10 Rather than allowing a catastrophic hard-crash of the CUDA driver, the scheduler triggers preemptive eviction.5  
Because the key-value states of a sequence are tightly coupled, PagedAttention executes an "all-or-nothing" eviction policy.10 The scheduler selects active requests (typically starting from the lowest-priority, most recent arrivals under a First-Come, First-Served queue) and evicts their entire KV block set.5 The evicted sequence is transitioned to a suspended state and placed back into the scheduling queue.10  
Preemption is executed via one of two distinct strategies:

1. **Recompute**: The entire KV cache of the victim request is discarded.5 When GPU memory pressure eases, the request is re-admitted, and the system executes a full prefill pass from scratch to rebuild the KV cache.5 This avoids PCIe bandwidth overhead but consumes significant GPU compute cycles during re-admission.5  
2. **Swap**: The physical blocks of the victim request are serialized and copied from high-speed GPU HBM to host CPU DRAM over the PCIe bus.5 When the request is resumed, these blocks are transferred back to the GPU.9 While this preserves computed states, host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) copy latencies can introduce severe latency stalls (often hundreds of milliseconds over PCIe 4.0 x16 links).9

The core scheduler scheduling loop, depicting the iteration-level execution validation and preemption triggers, is outlined as follows 10:

```Python  
# Reference-style pseudocode inspired by iteration-level LLM schedulers.
# Purpose: allocate the next decode slot for each running sequence while
# preventing KV-cache block exhaustion from crashing the worker.

        while not self.block_manager.can_append_slot(seq_group):
            victim = self.select_preemption_victim(

                seq_group = None
                break

        if seq_group is None:
            continue

        # Physical memory is available. Commit the sequence to this iteration.
        self.block_manager.append_slot(seq_group)
        running_batch.append(seq_group)

    self.running_queue = running_batch

    return SchedulerOutputs(
        running=running_batch,
        preempted=preempted_batch,
    )
```

### **The Radix Tree Cache**

SGLang organizes prefix-cache metadata on the host CPU using a radix tree, also called a compressed trie. This mechanism, known as **RadixAttention**, stores shared prompt prefixes as paths through a token tree, with each node referencing the physical KV-cache blocks retained in GPU HBM.8 The tree does not cache “meaning.” It caches exact token-prefix structure. If the serialized prompt changes by even a small token-level difference—such as altered whitespace, reordered tool definitions, changed system text, or shifted variable placement—the request may fall onto a different path and lose reuse.

```

```

When a request is ingested, the scheduler walks the radix tree from the root, comparing the incoming token sequence against stored token spans.8 The result determines how much prefill computation can be avoided:

* **Full Prefix Hit:** The request’s stable prefix exactly matches an existing tree path whose KV blocks are still resident in GPU memory. The runtime locks the matched nodes, increments their reference counts, and bypasses prefill computation for that matched prefix. The dynamic suffix, if any, still requires prefill.

* **Partial Prefix Hit:** The request matches the tree for some initial token span but diverges at a later point, usually where user-specific content, retrieved evidence, or tool arguments begin. The runtime reuses the matched prefix KV blocks and computes prefill only for the unmatched suffix. The newly generated suffix blocks can then be appended as a new leaf.

* **Prefix Miss:** The request fails to match a reusable prefix path. The serving engine performs a normal prefill over the full compiled prompt and may insert the resulting KV blocks into the radix tree if cache policy, tenant scope, and capacity permit.

```
Incoming token sequence:

  [ Stable Prefix Tokens ][ Dynamic Suffix Tokens ]
           |                        |
           v                        v
  matched in radix tree        computed by prefill

Execution effect:

  Reuse cached KV blocks  +  Prefill only unmatched suffix
           |                        |
           +-----------+------------+
                       v
              [ Decode can begin ]
```

This structure is why prompt layout directly affects throughput. Static, high-reuse material—system instructions, tool schemas, output contracts, and long-lived templates—should be placed at the prompt root. Dynamic material—user messages, retrieved documents, transient memory, tool results—should be appended after the stable prefix. This maximizes the length of shared token paths and increases the `radix_prefix_match_length` telemetry signal.

The radix tree is ultimately bounded by the same HBM pool that stores active KV-cache blocks. When the physical block pool saturates, the runtime must evict cached nodes. SGLang-style runtimes use a leaf-first LRU policy: low-reuse leaf nodes, usually unique user-query suffixes, are evicted before high-reuse parent prefixes.14 Active nodes are protected by reference counts while live requests depend on them; once those counts fall to zero, the node becomes eligible for eviction according to policy.

```

RadixAttention therefore functions as a physical throughput multiplier, not an abstract memory feature. It reduces redundant prefill work, lowers TTFT for repeated prompt structures, and improves GPU utilization—but only when upstream prompt serialization is stable. Prompt churn creates cache-miss storms; stable prompt roots create reusable KV highways.

## **Caching Strategy Matrix**

To minimize compute redundancy and physical transport bottlenecks, modern runtimes utilize a diverse array of caching layers. Each layer targets distinct performance gains while introducing specific structural, consistency, and security boundaries:

| Cache Class | Reused Resource | Computation Saved | Primary Invalidation Trigger | Security / Access Risk | Freshness Risk | Key Telemetry Indicator |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Prompt Caching** 8 | Pre-computed KV state tensors of stable prompt prefixes.8 | Prefill forward pass compute (GEMM-heavy FLOPS).2 | Byte-level modification of the cached instruction string.8 | Low. Instructions are typically static and system-wide.8 | Low. Instantiated during system configuration releases. | prefix_cache_hit_ratio.9 |
| **Prefix Caching** 8 | Sub-sequences of common tokens (e.g., shared templates).8 | Prefill computations for the matched prefix token range.8 | Positional changes or variable insertions within the prefix path.8 | Low. Prefix templates are restricted to core system scopes.8 | Low. Updates are bound to structural release manifests.8 | radix_prefix_match_length.8 |
| **KV Cache Reuse** 15 | Session-specific KV tensors across multi-turn chats.15 | Full conversational history recalculation at each turn.20 | Exceeding session TTL; explicit thread termination events. | High. Cross-contamination risk between user sessions.8 | Low. Tightly coupled to the active execution state. | session_block_retention_rate. |
| **Semantic Caching** 15 | Complete natural language response strings.15 | Full forward passes of both prefill and decode stages.15 | Vector distance drift of incoming queries; explicit purges. | Critical. Risk of serving user A's private data to user B.22 | High. External knowledge base updates bypass the cache.16 | semantic_cache_hit_distance. |
| **Retrieval-Result Caching** 8 | Raw text or embeddings of dynamic fetched contexts.8 | Vector database query execution and index scan times. | Updates to the underlying vector index or document store.8 | High. Requires strict row-level security (RLS) enforcement. | High. Stale documents are served if indices update.8 | retrieval_cache_latency_saved. |
| **Tool-Result Caching** | Outputs of external functional executions (APIs, calculators). | Downstream API round-trip times and external platform costs. | Time-To-Live (TTL) expiration; system state transitions. | Medium. Cached tool outputs must respect authorization bounds. | High. Real-time APIs (e.g., stock charts) rot rapidly. | tool_api_avoidance_rate. |
| **Answer Caching** | Deterministic outputs of specific input hashes. | Full model evaluation; network and pipeline transport times. | Changes to prompt, system config, or temperature variables. | High. Output data must align with active user permission scopes. | High. Directly bypasses dynamic real-time lookups. | answer_cache_hit_ratio. |
| **Embedding Caching** | Dense vector representations of input text strings. | Host-to-device transfers; embedding model forward passes. | Character modification or normalization changes of input text. | Low. Vectors are abstract representations but contain information. | Low. Core embedding models are highly static. | embedding_hit_ratio. |
| **Compiled-Context Caching** | Structured context matrices ready for direct attention mapping.8 | Host-side tokenization and memory layout compilation times.20 | Updates to the underlying context-compiler layout logic.8 | Medium. Memory layouts must strictly segment tenant metadata. | Medium. Changes to reference bundles invalidate layouts.8 | context_compile_hit_ratio. |

### **The Tenure Principle and Cache Key Composition**

To prevent cached states from bypassing security controls, freshness guarantees, or deployment boundaries, every cache entry must obey the **Tenure Principle**:

**A cached artifact is valid only inside the exact execution tenure that produced it.**

A cache entry must never be treated as an anonymous tensor, text fragment, or response string. It must carry a structured wrapper describing who may reuse it, when it expires, which release produced it, and which policy boundaries were active at creation time.

A safe cache key binds the physical token content to the surrounding execution context:

```text
CacheKey = Hash(
  TokenIDs,
  TenantID,
  UserOrPrincipalScope,
  AccessPermissionSet,
  ReleaseManifestID,
  ModelOrEmbeddingVersion,
  PromptTemplateVersion,
  CorpusSnapshotID,
  ToolSchemaVersionSet,
  SafetyPolicyVersion,
  TemporalTTL,
  CachePurpose
)
```

This prevents a cache hit from crossing boundaries that merely happen to share the same token string.

For example, two users may submit identical prompts, but their cache entries must diverge if they have different tenant IDs, document permissions, release manifests, retrieval snapshots, or tool authorization scopes. A token-level match is necessary but not sufficient for reuse.

| Cache-Key Component       | Purpose                                                                                  |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TokenIDs`                | Ensures the cached artifact corresponds to the exact serialized model input.             |
| `TenantID`                | Prevents cross-tenant leakage.                                                           |
| `UserOrPrincipalScope`    | Binds reuse to the authenticated caller or authorized group.                             |
| `AccessPermissionSet`     | Prevents reuse when document or tool permissions differ.                                 |
| `ReleaseManifestID`       | Invalidates cache entries when model, prompt, schema, routing, or safety config changes. |
| `ModelOrEmbeddingVersion` | Prevents reuse across incompatible model or embedding coordinate spaces.                 |
| `PromptTemplateVersion`   | Invalidates prefix and answer caches after prompt layout changes.                        |
| `CorpusSnapshotID`        | Prevents stale retrieval or answer caches after source documents change.                 |
| `ToolSchemaVersionSet`    | Prevents cached tool calls or tool results from surviving schema changes.                |
| `SafetyPolicyVersion`     | Prevents reuse across changed moderation or refusal boundaries.                          |
| `TemporalTTL`             | Bounds cache lifetime for dynamic facts and volatile tool results.                       |
| `CachePurpose`            | Separates prefix, semantic, retrieval-result, tool-result, and answer caches.            |

If an incoming request matches the same `TokenIDs` but fails any tenure check, the runtime must reject the cache hit and route the request to a clean computation path.

This distinction is especially important for semantic caching. A semantic cache may find that two queries are meaningfully similar, but semantic similarity does not imply equivalent authorization, freshness, or execution context. The cache hit is valid only if the tenure wrapper also matches.

```text
Cache lookup decision:

  token or semantic match?
        |
        v
  tenure wrapper match?
        |
        +--> no  -> reject cache hit; recompute safely
        |
        +--> yes -> reuse cached artifact within its allowed scope
```

The Tenure Principle turns caching from an unsafe shortcut into a governed performance layer. It preserves the speed benefits of reuse without allowing stale, cross-tenant, or policy-invalid data to leak through the memory system.


## **GPU Memory Pressure and CPU/GPU Tradeoffs**

The capacity of an accelerator memory system (such as HBM3/HBM3e) is the primary constraint on concurrent serving performance.1 To prevent out-of-memory crashes, VRAM must be segmented into distinct allocation domains.8

### **VRAM Memory Pressure Map**

The total allocated VRAM of an active inference-serving GPU is divided across static model residency, dynamic request state, and runtime execution overhead:

`V_allocated = V_weights + V_cache + V_activations + V_adapters + V_runtime + V_scratch`

Where:

| Term | Allocation Domain | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `V_weights` | Model weights | Mostly static after model load. Depends on parameter count, quantization format, and tensor-parallel sharding. |
| `V_cache` | KV cache pool | Dynamic. Grows with sequence length, output length, and active concurrency. Usually the main production capacity governor. |
| `V_activations` | Temporary activations | Transient. Spikes during prefill and forward passes, then is reclaimed. |
| `V_adapters` | LoRA / adapter weights | Semi-dynamic. Depends on active adapter count, rank, serving policy, and tenant mix. |
| `V_runtime` | Runtime metadata and CUDA graph overhead | Runtime-reserved memory for block tables, scheduler state, allocator metadata, CUDA graphs, compiled kernels, and framework buffers. |
| `V_scratch` | Scratchpad tensors | Temporary workspace for kernels, sorting, copying, sampling, dequantization, and intermediate operations. |

```

|   |                               |                               |

|   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Practical reading:
|
|   Model weights determine the static floor.
|   KV cache determines concurrency and sustainable context length.
|   Activations determine prefill spikes.
|   Adapters determine multi-tenant specialization overhead.
|   Runtime and scratch allocations determine the safety margin.
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

* **Model Weights (`V_weights`)**: The static footprint required to keep parameter matrices resident in GPU memory. A 70B parameter model requires about `140 GB` in FP16/BF16 or about `70 GB` in FP8/INT8-style one-byte formats before accounting for sharding, metadata, and runtime overhead.

* **KV Cache Pool (`V_cache`)**: The dynamic pool reserved for attention key/value states. It scales with active sequence count, context length, generated tokens, layer count, KV head count, head dimension, and KV precision. In production serving, this is usually the first domain to create capacity pressure.

* **Activations (`V_activations`)**: Temporary intermediate tensors created during forward passes. Activation pressure is especially visible during large prefill operations and high batch concurrency. These allocations are reclaimed after the kernel path completes but can still trigger short-lived memory spikes.

* **Adapters (`V_adapters`)**: Memory allocated for parameter-efficient fine-tuning artifacts such as LoRA adapters. Adapter pressure increases when many tenants, domains, or workflows require concurrently resident adapters.

* **Runtime Metadata and CUDA Graph Overhead (`V_runtime`)**: Memory reserved by the serving engine for allocator structures, block tables, CUDA graphs, scheduler metadata, compiled kernels, framework state, and execution bookkeeping. This should be treated as a real capacity reservation, not miscellaneous dust under the GPU couch.

* **Scratchpad Tensors (`V_scratch`)**: Temporary workspace used for kernel execution, tensor copies, sampling, sorting, dequantization, constrained decoding, and other intermediate operations.

Because model weights are mostly static after load, optimization focuses on the trade-off between weight precision and KV-cache budget. Reducing the model weight footprint can reclaim HBM for dynamic sequence state, but safe capacity planning must reserve margin for activations, adapters, runtime metadata, scratchpad buffers, and burst traffic.


### **CPU/GPU Tradeoff Model**

When serving models that exceed the local aggregate HBM pool, runtimes can offload segments to system DRAM or CXL storage tiers.9 This trade-off balances capacity against throughput across multiple hardware interconnect layers:

| Memory Tier | Physical Capacity | Peak Bandwidth | Interconnect Protocol | Latency Cost (Decode) | Systemic Role |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **GPU SRAM** | 10 - 250 MB | 10 - 50 TB/s | On-chip memory bus | Sub-nanosecond | L1/L2 caches; local registers for active thread blocks. |
| **GPU HBM** 1 | 80 - 192 GB 1 | 3.35 - 8.0 TB/s 1 | Co-packaged silicon interposer 1 | Baseline (1.0) 1 | Primary residency for weights, activations, and active KV cache.21 |
| **NVLink Interconnect** 8 | Multi-GPU unified pool | 900 GB/s 8 | Custom NVLink routing fabric 8 | 2x - 3x latency multiplier | Inter-GPU weight sharding (TP >= 2) and KV cache transfer.8 |
| **System DRAM (Host)** 9 | 512 GB - 4.0 TB | 100 - 300 GB/s | DDR5 memory bus | 20x - 40x latency multiplier | Primary residency for host metadata, tokenizers, and swapped cache.6 |
| **CXL Switched DRAM** 26 | 1.0 - 8.0 TB | 32 - 128 GB/s | Compute Express Link (CXL over PCIe) 26 | 40x - 100x latency multiplier | Ultra-large shared memory pools for cold-state KV caches.26 |
| **PCIe Bus Link** 8 | N/A | 32 - 64 GB/s (x16 link) 9 | PCIe Gen 4 / Gen 5 standard 9 | 50x - 120x latency multiplier | Host-to-Device transfer bridge; bottleneck for swapping operations.9 |

Offloading weight states or KV cache blocks to CPU DRAM or CXL storage expands context capacities but alters performance characteristics.9 Because host system DRAM bandwidth is up to thirty times slower than GPU HBM3, any step requiring data retrieval from host memory halts the GPU's execution pipeline.1 Offloading is highly effective for extending context size limits during slow asynchronous workloads, but it remains impractical for low-latency interactive serving.

## **Batching, Queueing, and Scheduler Behavior**

To amortize the high memory bandwidth cost of weight transfers, runtimes aggregate independent requests into parallel execution batches.1 However, the scheduling of these batches directly impacts system latency profiles and queueing stability.3

### **Batching Mechanics**

Traditional static batching processes a fixed set of requests simultaneously, running until the longest response completes.5 This approach introduces severe tail latency (P99) because short requests are blocked by long-running requests.9 Continuous batching (or iteration-level scheduling) resolves this by evaluating the batch at every token generation step.5 Completed requests are dropped immediately, and new requests are admitted from the queue.5

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| STATIC BATCHING
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Behavior:
|   A fixed batch is admitted. The batch runs until the slowest sequence finishes.
|
| Time ---->
|
|   Req A: [prefill][decode][done]
|   Req B: [prefill][decode][decode][decode][decode][done]
|   Req C: [prefill][decode][done]
|   Req D: [prefill][decode][decode][done]
|
| Batch slot occupancy:
|
|   Step 1: A B C D active
|   Step 2: A B C D active
|   Step 3:   B   D active     A and C are done, but their slots are wasted
|   Step 4:   B     active     D is done, but the batch still waits on B
|   Step 5:   B     active
|
| Consequence:
|   Short requests suffer head-of-line blocking behind long requests.
|   GPU work is wasted on padding or idle batch slots.
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| CONTINUOUS BATCHING / ITERATION-LEVEL SCHEDULING
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Behavior:
|   The scheduler updates the active batch at every decode iteration.
|   Completed sequences leave immediately. New sequences enter available slots.
|
| Time ---->
|
|   Iteration 1:  Req A   Req B   Req C   Req D
|   Iteration 2:  Req A   Req B   Req C   Req D
|   Iteration 3:  Req E   Req B   Req F   Req D     A and C completed; E/F enter
|   Iteration 4:  Req E   Req B   Req F   Req G     D completed; G enters
|   Iteration 5:  Req H   Req B   Req F   Req G     E completed; H enters
|
| Scheduler loop:
|
|   decode one token for active sequences
|   release completed sequences
|   admit waiting sequences if memory blocks are available
|   preempt or delay sequences if KV-cache pressure is too high
|

| WHY CHUNKED PREFILL MATTERS
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Problem:
|   A long prompt prefill can monopolize compute and delay active decode streams.

|
| With chunked prefill:
|
|   [prefill chunk][decode][prefill chunk][decode][prefill chunk][decode]

| Consequence:

Under continuous batching, the scheduler manages sequence length heterogeneity and early finishes dynamically, keeping the GPU highly utilized.8

### **Queueing Theory and Capacity Sizing**

When designing inference fleets, arrival patterns are inherently stochastic, behaving as classical M/M/c queueing systems governed by the Erlang-C formula. The offered system load (rho) for a fleet of c GPUs with arrival rate lambda and mean service time S is modeled by:  
rho = (lambda * S) / c  
The probability that an incoming request is forced to wait in the ingestion queue is defined by:  
P(W_q > 0) = C(c, a) = ((a^c) / (c! * (1 - rho))) / (sum_{k=0}^{c-1} (a^k / k!) + (a^c) / (c! * (1 - rho))) where a = lambda * S  
The expected queue wait time (E) is:  
E = C(c, a) * S / (c * (1 - rho))  
The critical constraint is the (1 - rho) denominator. As system utilization approaches saturation (rho -> 1.0), expected queue latency scales twentyfold, violating latency SLAs without any change in the model's physical execution speed.

```

  0%                               80%         95%   System Utilization (rho)
```

If a fleet operates at 50% utilization, the queue wait time is minor. If a sudden demand spike shifts utilization to 95%, expected queue latency scales twentyfold, violating latency SLAs without any change in the model's physical execution speed.

### **Scheduler Policies as Product Decisions**

Scheduler policies directly shape user experience and system cost profiles. Schedulers must evaluate multiple priorities when dispatching execution batches:

* **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Admits requests sequentially.5 This approach is highly fair but prone to head-of-line blocking under mixed workloads.5  
* **Virtual Lag Time (VLT) / Largest-VLT-First**: Prioritizes requests at risk of violating latency SLAs. This optimization ensures SLA compliance but can degrade system throughput.  
* **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) / Length Prediction**: Uses proxy models to predict sequence length, prioritizing short requests to minimize queue latency.17 This policy can starve long-context sequences under heavy load.

## **Capacity Planning Framework**

To size physical GPU capacity, architects must evaluate production traces using p50, p95, and p99 distributions rather than average workload metrics. Inference capacity is governed by the interaction between model weight residency, dynamic KV-cache growth, sequence length, batch concurrency, cache-hit behavior, and arrival-rate burstiness.

This section uses **GiB** for memory-capacity arithmetic. Vendor GPU specifications are often advertised in decimal **GB**, so they must be converted before comparing against binary workload calculations.

### **Sizing Methodology**

Let a multi-tenant production environment be characterized by three workload profiles:

`T_mix = { w_conversational -> 70%, w_rag -> 20%, w_agent_loops -> 10% }`

The p95 workload attributes are:

* **Conversational:** `N_in_p95 = 1024`, `N_out_p95 = 256`
* **RAG Contexts:** `N_in_p95 = 16384`, `N_out_p95 = 512`
* **Agent Loops:** `N_in_p95 = 32768`, `N_out_p95 = 128`

The objective is to size an accelerator cluster to guarantee an inter-token latency target of:

`t_step <= 25 ms`

under peak concurrent execution using a Llama-class 70B model with FP8 KV-cache precision:

`b = 1 byte`

Architectural parameters:

* Layer count: `L = 80`
* KV head count: `H_kv = 8`
* Head dimension: `d = 128`

### **Step 1: Calculate Static Weight and Runtime Footprint**

Choose an H200-class GPU advertised with approximately `141 GB` of HBM.

Convert advertised decimal capacity to binary capacity:

`141 GB decimal = 141,000,000,000 bytes ≈ 131.32 GiB`

The FP8 model weight footprint is:

`V_weights = 70,000,000,000 bytes ≈ 65.19 GiB`

Reserve runtime and allocator overhead:

`V_runtime = 5,000,000,000 bytes ≈ 4.66 GiB`

The remaining dynamic block pool is therefore:

`V_pool = 131.32 GiB - 65.19 GiB - 4.66 GiB`

`V_pool ≈ 61.47 GiB`

This is the approximate pool available for dynamic KV cache, allocator metadata, active sequence state, and operational margin.

#### **Step 2: Compute Per-Sequence KV-Cache Demand**

The KV-cache footprint for a single active sequence is:

`V_seq = 2 * L * H_kv * d * N_context * b`

Where:

`N_context = N_in + N_out`

Using the p95 sequence lengths:

| Workload Type | p95 Input Tokens | p95 Output Tokens | p95 Context Tokens | Per-Sequence KV Demand |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Conversational** | `1,024` | `256` | `1,280` | `209,715,200 bytes ≈ 0.195 GiB` |
| **RAG Contexts** | `16,384` | `512` | `16,896` | `2,768,240,640 bytes ≈ 2.578 GiB` |
| **Agent Loops** | `32,768` | `128` | `32,896` | `5,389,680,640 bytes ≈ 5.020 GiB` |

These values represent dynamic KV-cache demand only. They do not include model weights, transient activations, adapters, runtime metadata, CUDA graphs, scratchpad tensors, fragmentation margin, or serving-engine overhead.

#### **Step 3: Size Active Concurrency Against the Safe KV Pool**

Assume the peak active batch contains `B = 40` concurrent streams with the target workload mix:

| Workload Type | Share | Active Streams | Per-Sequence KV Demand | Aggregate KV Demand |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Conversational** | `70%` | `28` | `0.195 GiB` | `5.46 GiB` |
| **RAG Contexts** | `20%` | `8` | `2.578 GiB` | `20.62 GiB` |
| **Agent Loops** | `10%` | `4` | `5.020 GiB` | `20.08 GiB` |
| **Total** | `100%` | `40` | — | `46.16 GiB` |

The remaining dynamic block pool from Step 1 is:

`V_pool ≈ 61.47 GiB`

Apply a 30% capacity margin to absorb p99 sequence growth, bursty arrivals, cache-miss storms, tenant skew, tool-wait amplification, allocator overhead, and failover pressure:

`V_limit_safe = V_pool * (1 - 0.30)`

`V_limit_safe = 61.47 GiB * 0.70`

`V_limit_safe ≈ 43.03 GiB`

The p95 active workload therefore exceeds the safe operating envelope:

`46.16 GiB > 43.03 GiB`

The workload may technically fit inside the raw dynamic pool:

`46.16 GiB < 61.47 GiB`

But it does **not** fit inside the production-safe capacity envelope. A single GPU may hold the p95 batch under ideal conditions, but it leaves insufficient margin for p99 contexts, sudden arrival bursts, cache-hit collapse, preemption recovery, tool waits, and failover events.

The capacity conclusion is:

**This single-GPU configuration is physically plausible but operationally unsafe. The fleet must add memory capacity, reduce active concurrency, shorten contexts, improve cache reuse, or route long-context workloads to a separate lane.**### **Step 4: Interpret Horizontal Scaling and Tensor Parallelism Carefully**

To maintain stable service, architects must add capacity until the p95 workload fits comfortably below the safe dynamic block-pool limit and p99 workloads can be absorbed without persistent preemption.

Horizontal replication increases request-serving capacity by spreading independent requests across multiple model replicas.

Tensor parallelism increases the aggregate HBM available to one sharded model instance, but its usable KV-cache capacity depends on the serving architecture.

A statement such as “TP = 4 provides 264 GB of dynamic block-pool memory” should be treated as an approximation, not a universal rule. The usable memory depends on:

* how model weights are sharded
* whether KV cache is replicated, sharded, or partitioned by runtime policy
* tensor-parallel communication overhead
* CUDA graph and allocator overhead
* interconnect bandwidth and latency
* whether the deployment uses prefill/decode disaggregation
* whether adapters, speculative decoding, or constrained decoding consume additional memory

A cleaner capacity statement is:

Using four H200-class GPUs increases aggregate HBM and allows the runtime to distribute model weights and serving state across a larger memory pool. Under tensor parallelism, this can substantially expand the practical KV-cache budget, but the exact safe concurrency limit must be measured with the target serving engine, model architecture, sharding plan, and workload trace distribution.

### **Step 5: Capacity Planning Rule**

A serving plan is healthy only when all of the following remain true under p95 and burst-tested p99 traffic:

* free KV block count remains above the safety threshold
* preemption rate remains near zero
* p95 TTFT remains inside the latency SLO
* p99 ITL does not spike during long-context prefills
* queue wait time does not grow monotonically
* cache-hit collapse does not push the system into sustained full-prefill mode
* failover can occur without saturating the surviving replicas

Capacity planning should therefore be based on trace replay and stress simulation, not average request length or theoretical maximum context size.

## **Runtime Failure Mode Map**

Under high workload intensity, inference runtimes face unique failure modes driven by memory constraints and queueing dynamics.22 The following map details the symptoms, root causes, detection signals, and remediation strategies for these failures:

## **Runtime Observability Guidance**

To maintain high availability and prevent performance regressions, platform engineers must track metrics across three hardware and software execution domains:

The critical observability indicators required to monitor throughput health and diagnose performance bottlenecks are defined below:

| Domain | Telemetry Metric | Recommended Target Boundary | Physical Measurement Meaning | Diagnostic Utility |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Hardware** | **Effective Memory Bandwidth Utilization (MBU%)** 1 | 75% - 88% | The percentage of peak memory bandwidth actively utilized by the GPU memory controllers.1 | Low MBU% during decoding indicates scheduling overhead, small batch sizes, or PCIe bottlenecks.1 |
| **Hardware** | **SM Utilization (SM%)** 1 | > 85% (Prefill), < 15% (Decode) 1 | The percentage of active streaming multiprocessors executing GPU instructions.1 | High SM% combined with low MBU% indicates compute-bound prefill; low SM% with high MBU% confirms memory-bandwidth-bound decoding.1 |

## **Durable Principles**

### **I. Memory Governs Intelligence**

The throughput of an inference engine is constrained by how efficiently data moves through hardware, not by the model's parameter size.1 System optimization must focus on maximizing memory bandwidth utilization (MBU%) and minimizing cache fragmentation.1

### **II. Optimize Prefill and Decode Independently**

Prefill is compute-bound, while decode is memory-bandwidth-bound.1 Systems must separate these workloads using chunked prefill or dedicated hardware nodes to prevent large prefill steps from stalling concurrent decoding streams.8

### **III. Treat Every Token as a Physical Memory Allocation**

A sequence is not an abstract stream of text; it is a dynamic allocation of physical VRAM.6 Every generated token consumes space, and the scheduler must manage these block tables dynamically to prevent preemption loops and system crashes.10

### **IV. Enforce the Tenure Principle Securely**

Prefix caching and semantic caching are highly effective performance tools.8 However, every cached state must carry a strict tenure wrapper defining its tenant scope, temporal validity, and permissions to prevent security leaks across boundaries.

### **V. Queue Latency is Non-Linear**

System capacity must be sized for peak arrival variance rather than average workload volume. As system utilization approaches saturation, expected queue wait times climb exponentially, making high steady-state utilization a major risk to latency SLAs.

### **VI. Upstream Prompts Dictate Downstream System Stability**

Throughput failures often originate upstream in prompt design.8 Dynamic context payloads, varying templates, and unstructured formatting invalidate prefix caches, creating high prefill overhead and saturating hardware under load.8
