# AI-ENG-L — Model Serving Architecture - Routing, Load Balancing & Deployment Topologies

## **Doctrinal Paradigm: Traffic Governance for Probabilistic Compute**

Model serving in production enterprise systems represents a paradigm shift from hosting deterministic microservices to governing traffic across probabilistic compute pipelines.1 Traditional web serving assumes static request-response lifetimes, uniform resource footprints, and simple CPU or system memory bottlenecks.1 In contrast, serving architecture for large language models (LLMs) and foundation models must manage highly variable request processing times, dynamic memory footprints inside the High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) of graphics processing units (GPUs), and complex operational dependencies.1  

The core operational doctrine of this report dictates that:  

> *Serving architecture is traffic governance for probabilistic compute: route each request to the cheapest sufficient, authorized, available, latency-appropriate model path while preserving isolation, reliability, observability, and rollback.4*  

Treating model serving as merely hosting a weight checkpoint behind an endpoint ignores the operational realities of hardware scarcity, variable context lengths, and tenant-level resource contention.1 The useful question is not "Where is the model hosted?" but "How does each request move through gateway, authentication, tenant policy, routing, queueing, cache, inference execution, validation, fallback, telemetry, and rollback under real production constraints?".4  
This architectural paradigm requires a decoupled design divided into a control plane and a data plane:

* **The Control Plane:** Manages configuration states, release pipelines, routing topologies, tenant quota definitions, scale targets, safety policies, and model metadata registries. It handles the declarative definition of model-serving environments, enabling operators to modify routing rules or adjust capacity allocations without rebuilding execution containers or disrupting live connections.  

* **The Data Plane:** Executes in the direct path of user requests. It performs request admission, tokenizes incoming prompts, extracts routing keys, queries cache states, schedules iteration-level batches, coordinates KV cache transfers, executes model inference on raw hardware, validates output structures, streams responses, and pumps telemetry events to collectors.2

By segregating these concerns, platform engineers can update routing heuristics, hot-swap model versions, scale capacity pools dynamically, and isolate tenant-level anomalies without introducing downtime or risking structural regressions inside the physical execution layer.2  

This report closes Volume 4: Runtime Architecture and Inference Mechanics, whose concern is how AI systems execute under physical, computational, and operational constraints. AI-ENG-J established throughput mechanics: prefill, decode, KV cache, batching, queueing, cache pressure, memory pressure, and capacity margins. AI-ENG-K established weight dynamics and decoding strategy: quantization, compression, speculative decoding, constrained decoding, sampling policies, kernel compatibility, and behavior-preserving optimization. AI-ENG-L now defines how inference capacity is deployed, exposed, routed, scaled, protected, and recovered in production.  

This report draws clean boundaries. AI-ENG-J owns the physical mechanics inside inference execution. AI-ENG-K owns numerical representation, compression, and decoding optimization. AI-ENG-L owns the serving topology around those engines: gateways, routers, load balancers, inference servers, model residency, local, edge, or cloud deployment, tenant-aware capacity, queues, autoscaling, cold starts, rate limits, backpressure, failover, high availability, and degraded serving patterns.4

## **Conceptual Glossary**

To ensure structural durability for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and establish a rigorous baseline for platform engineering, this section defines the core components of high-dimensional serving architectures.

| Term | Architectural Definition | Operational Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Model Serving Architecture** | The control and data plane coordination layers that expose inference capacity to clients while managing system resources.6 | Governs how requests traverse physical networks to reach optimized, validated hardware partitions.13 |
| **Inference Server** | A specialized runtime engine that loads model weights, manages physical GPU memory, batches requests, and executes optimized compute kernels.14 | Directly interfaces with hardware via runtimes like vLLM, SGLang, and Triton.15 |
| **Model Gateway** | An intelligent proxy plane that centralizes model routing, tokenization, tracking, and telemetry.6 | Acts as a unified entrypoint for upstream client requests, decoupling application logic from backend runtimes.6 |
| **API Gateway** | An edge proxy that handles external client ingress, transport-layer security (TLS), global authentication, and rate-limiting.8 | Acts as the first line of defense, validating incoming HTTP/gRPC requests before forwarding them.19 |
| **Control Plane** | The system layer that manages declarative configurations, release manifests, and routing topologies.13 | Syncs state updates across the fleet asynchronously without interrupting the active request-handling path.13 |
| **Data Plane** | The execution path that tokenizes prompts, manages physical KV caches, executes model kernels, and streams tokens.6 | Operates under strict latency constraints (milliseconds) to handle live inference traffic.17 |
| **Routing Policy** | A behavioral configuration defining the rules that match a request context to a target model endpoint.4 | Maps incoming prompts to the most cost-effective, high-performing model path.4 |
| **Model Portfolio** | The heterogeneous collection of active models, quantization formats, and specialized task adapters.3 | Enables cost-performance optimization by matching tasks to tailored, specialized model tiers.3 |
| **Load Balancing** | Memory-, cache-, and tenant-aware traffic distribution across homogeneous or heterogeneous GPU replicas.1 | Prevents resource imbalances and avoids premature evictions of hot prefix caches.23 |
| **Tenant-Aware Capacity** | The logical or physical partitioning of model execution resources based on tenant identity and priority.2 | Prevents high-volume tenants from starving others of HBM slots or queuing capacity.2 |
| **Admission Control** | The gateway-level mechanism that intercepts, queues, or rejects incoming traffic based on active system saturation.3 | Protects physical GPU clusters from thrashing and memory exhaustion during traffic spikes.3 |
| **Backpressure** | Controlled resistance applied to upstream clients (e.g., HTTP 429 errors or queue delays) when system limits are reached.2 | Prevents the serving cluster from collapsing under unexpected or bursty workloads.24 |
| **Autoscaling** | The elastic provisioning of model replicas and physical GPU nodes based on live queue depth and cache saturation.7 | Automatically adjusts system capacity to match incoming load while minimizing idle hardware costs.9 |
| **Cold Start** | The latency delay incurred when provisioning a new replica, downloading weights, and compiling GPU kernels.8 | Can span minutes, requiring active mitigations to protect user-facing latency SLAs.9 |
| **Model Residency** | The operational state determining whether model weights are kept warm in VRAM, cached on SSD, or stored in cold registries.8 | Governs the tradeoff between immediate latency availability and active hardware memory footprints.8 |
| **Rate Limit** | A resource-aware safety ceiling capping requests, tokens, or concurrency metrics per unit of time. | Enforces usage policies and protects backend infrastructure from runaway client loops. |
| **Quota** | A contract-level budget defining the maximum allowable consumption (e.g., total tokens or spend limits) over long intervals. | Governs tenant-level entitlement limits for billing, budget enforcement, and cost controls. |
| **Fallback Route** | An alternative model or execution path automatically triggered when the primary route degrades or fails.8 | Guarantees continuous service availability during provider outages or local hardware failures.27 |
| **Degraded Mode** | A resilient operating state that serves lower-fidelity responses or limits features when resources are constrained.8 | Preserves basic user functionality and system trust rather than returning abrupt error states.8 |
| **High Availability** | The architectural design that minimizes downtime through replica redundancy, health checks, and automatic failovers.6 | Guarantees continuous platform access across hardware failures, zone drops, and cloud outages.6 |
| **Failover** | The automated routing transition that shifts active traffic from an unhealthy component to a healthy backup.27 | Isolates hardware and network anomalies instantly to preserve user-facing SLAs.27 |
| **Serving Trace** | A distributed log mapping a request's journey across gateways, routers, caches, and execution runtimes.6 | Enables regression audits, security forensic analysis, and granular tenant cost attribution.8 |

## **Serving Stack Reference Architecture**

A robust serving platform must orchestrate multiple software and hardware layers to deliver deterministic SLAs on top of non-deterministic model engines. The reference architecture diagram below traces the path of a client request down to physical GPU clusters.

### **Serving Stack Reference Architecture**

| Layer | Primary Responsibility | Representative Technologies | Fail-Safe Behavior |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **API Gateway / Ingress** | Handles client ingress, transport-layer security (TLS) termination, global rate-limiting, and corporate SSO integration.8 | Kong, Envoy, Istio Ingress, AWS API Gateway. | Fails closed on authentication failures; returns a static HTTP 403 response. |
| **Tenant Policy Engine** | Validates API keys, extracts tenant contexts, and enforces quotas and RPM limits. | Custom API Proxy with Redis Cluster backend. | Strips premium headers; routes requests to the public, low-tier pool. |
| **Request Classification** | Inspects request payloads to identify target modalities, language profiles, and expected context lengths.3 | ModernBERT classifiers, lightweight transformer sidecars.22 | Defaults to the standard text routing path if classification fails.4 |
| **Model Router** | Evaluates the model portfolio to determine the optimal target endpoint based on task difficulty and cost limits.4 | SGLang Model Gateway, RouteLLM, Not Diamond, LiteLLM.6 | Defaults to a high-capacity frontier model if difficulty checks timeout.4 |
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes requests based on queue depths, prefix cache affinity, and adapter residency.3 | Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension, llm-d, sgl-router.23 | Falls back to standard round-robin or least-loaded node routing.30 |
| **Queue / Admission Layer** | Buffers incoming requests and enforces priority scheduling to protect backend runtimes.2 | Endpoint Proxy Plane (EPP) Flow Control, Redis-backed priority queues.2 | Rejects low-priority requests with HTTP 429 errors during peaks.2 |
| **Cache Layers** | Performs high-speed semantic caching and tracks active physical prefix caches.5 | Redis Enterprise, Milvus, SGLang RadixCache.5 | Bypasses caching entirely, routing requests directly to execution. |
| **Inference Servers** | Manages logical-to-physical block allocations, continuous batch schedules, and execution optimization.14 | vLLM, SGLang Runtime, Triton Inference Server, TensorRT-LLM.15 | Triggers preemption and recomputation, or falls back to swap space.3 |
| **Model Registry** | Stores and distributes version-pinned, SHA-validated immutable weight checkpoints.8 | Unity Catalog, MLflow Registry, OCI-compliant Artifact Stores.8 | Halts deployment; rolls back to preceding SHA-validated active container.8 |
| **Artifact Store** | Stores high-capacity weight checkpoints and dynamic LoRA adapter files.3 | AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, local SAN networks.8 | Halts container initialization; alerts SREs of storage timeout.8 |
| **Retrieval / Tool Sidecars** | Coordinates real-time tool calls and fetches external document embeddings.6 | Ray Serve applications, Composio MCP Gateways.22 | Disables tool access; routes prompt to direct fallback model.8 |
| **Validators** | Verifies structural output conformance (e.g., JSON schemas) and checks reasoning traces.6 | Guardrails AI, LlamaGuard, custom regex parsing layers.6 | Triggers fallback model routing or returns a clean validation error.8 |
| **Telemetry** | Collects and aggregates system logs, trace records, and Prometheus metrics.6 | OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Datadog Agent, ClickHouse.6 | Continues serving traffic silently; drops metrics locally to prevent leaks.3 |
| **Fallback** | Coordinates alternative execution paths across backup zones or external cloud providers.27 | LiteLLM Proxy, Custom Gateway Interceptor.27 | Returns a standardized "service degraded" HTTP 503 error to the client. |
| **Rollback Controller** | Automates traffic shifts and rollbacks of model versions during regressions.6 | GitOps controllers, ArgoCD, custom Kubernetes operators.19 | Freezes active traffic routing state; locks configuration deployments.8 |

### **Control Plane / Data Plane Coordination Model**

The control plane and data plane must coordinate synchronously on routing policies, capacity reservations, and telemetry, yet remain architecturally decoupled so that data-plane request execution is never blocked by control-plane latency or outages.

| System Aspect | Control Plane Responsibilities | Data Plane Responsibilities | Coordination & Sync Mechanisms |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Configuration & Routing** | Defines target models, weights, routing matrices, and canary split percentages.4 | Tokenizes prompts, extracts routing keys, and dispatches to chosen nodes.5 | Asynchronous gRPC config streaming via xDS APIs, avoiding blockages during database lookups. |
| **Tenant Quotas** | Manages tenant priority tiers, contract budgets, and rate limits. | Enforces sliding-window RPM limits and tracks token consumption. | Distributed key-value caching (Redis) updated asynchronously by control plane. |
| **Release Management** | Directs progressive rollouts and validates SHA-pinned image builds.8 | Executes canary splitting and routes traffic to warm instances.3 | Ingress-level weight updates synchronized across the proxy plane without dropping connections.19 |
| **Autoscaling** | Computes scale targets and provisions new virtual machines and nodes.9 | Reports queue depths, preemption metrics, and HBM memory states.9 | Prometheus metric scrapes combined with KEDA autoscaler control loops.3 |
| **Rollback & Failover** | Directs global rollbacks to previous stable manifests during failures.8 | Diverts requests to backup clusters or local fallback models.27 | High-speed health probes combined with automated circuit-breaker trips.6 |

## **Inference Server Layer Mechanics & Compatibility Gates**

The base engine of the serving architecture is the inference server. It abstracts raw GPU hardware, exposing a programmatic API while managing memory layouts, continuous batch schedules, and execution optimization.  
The responsibilities of the inference server are:

* **Model Loading and Weight Fetching:** Server engines must fetch, cache, and mount model weights.8 To avoid third-party CDN dependencies during container startups, optimized platforms pull weights from local, immutable OCI-compliant registries.8  
* **Request Scheduling and Batching:** Static batching is unusable in conversational applications due to high variance in output generation lifetimes.32 Modern runtimes execute continuous, iteration-level batching, where completed sequences are evicted and waiting requests are scheduled at the boundary of each individual token step.32  
* **Memory Management (Paged KV Cache):** To prevent memory fragmentation, engines partition key-value attention tensors into logical blocks.17 These are dynamically mapped to non-contiguous physical memory locations inside GPU HBM via lookup tables, mimicking virtual memory in operating systems.17  
* **Adapter and Multi-Model Support:** Runtimes must host a single base model while dynamically mapping Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters into active HBM space, ensuring adapter-specific routing without weight replication overhead.3  
* **Telemetry and Hook Points:** The engine must expose granular metrics (e.g., Time to First Token, Inter-Token Latency, HBM Cache occupancy) and support intermediate tensor inspection hooks for downstream validation processes.3

To evaluate how different platforms satisfy these core capabilities, engineers must analyze their architectural execution models.

### **Inference Server Architectural Responsibility Comparison**

| Serving Engine | Weight Loading & Lifecycle | Batch Scheduling Model | Memory Management (KV Cache) | Adapter & Multi-Model Support | Telemetry & Observability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **vLLM** | Pulls from local disk or Hugging Face; pins immutable SHAs.8 | Continuous, iteration-level batch scheduler with recompute/swap preemption.14 | PagedAttention mapping logical blocks to non-contiguous physical HBM.17 | Jointly manages multi-LoRA adapters using dynamic hash tables.3 | Exposes Prometheus endpoint tracking TTFT, ITL, and cache occupancy.3 |
| **SGLang** | PyO3 Python bindings wrapping Rust; manages fast weight loading.31 | Zero-overhead CPU batch scheduler prioritizing pending decodes.14 | RadixAttention tracking and caching common prefixes in an active radix tree.16 | Native support; incorporates prefix hashing to partition different adapters.17 | Provides granular metrics on radix cache hit rates and queue statuses.5 |
| **TensorRT-LLM** | Compiles model graphs to static engines; handles weight streaming.13 | In-flight batching with customized kernel execution schedules.15 | Paged KV cache allocation mapped to optimized tensor blocks.15 | Static engine configurations; requires predefined adapter pathways.13 | Exposes DCGM-level metrics and engine execution statistics.9 |
| **Triton Server** | Explicit model repository control; supports polling and explicit loads.37 | Configurable dynamic, sequence, and ensemble batch schedulers.38 | Decoupled; delegates memory allocation directly to backend runtimes.3 | Supports multi-model execution pathways via custom backends.3 | Exposes execution counts, queuing latencies, and engine errors.38 |
| **Ray Serve** | Python-native class deployment running on distributed Ray actors.7 | Custom ingress proxies that batch requests before forwarding.39 | Handled by child worker runtimes (e.g., vLLM or SGLang).35 | Manages model multiplexing via downstream worker actors.39 | Centralized dashboard tracking active actors and actor queue depths.35 |
| **KServe** | Serverless or raw deployments pulling from storage URIs.19 | Relies on underlying runtime engine batch scheduling.19 | Handled by the target serving container runtime.19 | Supports multi-model serving through pluggable runtimes.19 | Integrates with Knative and Istio to track ingress traffic rates.19 |

Before any model checkpoint or adapter is promoted to active serving, it must pass through a standardized compatibility gate. This gate acts as a validation pipeline, protecting physical hardware from runtime exceptions and memory failures.

## **Routing Architecture & Multi-Model Orchestration**

A multi-model routing layer transforms an expensive, fragile model cluster into a resilient, cost-efficient utility.4 Most production routing architectures implement a hybrid design: static routing rules process explicit identifiers, semantic routing evaluates prompt intents, and cascading pipelines handle failure recovery.4

```

Task-based and capability-based routing map straightforward requests to low-parameter models, while routing reasoning-heavy tasks to frontier networks.4 Risk-based routing automatically redirects high-stakes workflows (e.g., financial transactions or patient-facing diagnostic requests) to secure, pre-validated local models or human review queues.4  
Modality-based, language-based, and context-length routing evaluate prompt characteristics to match requests to hardware optimized for those targets.4 For example, prompts exceeding 32,000 tokens are routed away from memory-constrained local nodes to high-capacity cloud clusters.11 Tenant-tier and region routing enforce data residency requirements, guaranteeing that sensitive enterprise records remain within compliant geographic boundaries.2  
Cost-aware and latency-aware routing evaluate live metrics to balance execution pricing and speed.4 If the primary model’s queue latency spikes, confidence-based escalation and fallback routing immediately shift traffic to an alternative provider or equivalent open-weight replica.4 When automated tools or reasoning paths fail to return structured outputs, tool-first and human-review routing intercept the request, escalating the output to human administrators to preserve system trust.4  
Evaluating routing strategies requires analyzing their performance and latency overheads.

### **Routing Performance & Latency Matrix**

| Routing Method | Average Latency | Cost Impact | Typical Task | Typical Target Model |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Static Rules** | < 1ms | Fully predictable; zero routing overhead.4 | Structured classification with explicit tags.4 | Quantized 8B parameter model hosted locally.9 |
| **Semantic Routing** | 5-15ms 22 | High savings (60%+) by hitting local cache.28 | Near-duplicate customer support queries.28 | Local embedding similarity lookup with Redis.22 |
| **BERT Classifier** | 10-50ms 22 | Up to 85% cost reduction vs. using GPT-4 alone.29 | General conversational chats on public forums.44 | Fine-tuned 0.5B model classifying prompt difficulty.22 |
| **LLM Classifier** | 200-800ms 22 | Variable; high overhead can negate routing savings.22 | Complex code generation and analysis.44 | Claude Haiku evaluating prompt complexity.4 |
| **Cascading Fallback** | Variable 22 | High latency tax; adds roundtrips on escalations.22 | Multi-step agentic execution workflows.22 | Escalate to Sonnet if Haiku fails validation.4 |
| **Router-R1** | > 1000ms 22 | High; uses extensive reasoning step tokens.22 | Complex mathematical reasoning and proofs.22 | Specialized reasoning model with explicit thinking traces.22 |

A routing decision must be logged with its full context, capturing why alternative paths were rejected.4 If weak routing misclassifies hard tasks or overuses premium models, it can cause cost spikes or degrade system accuracy.4

## **Load Balancing for LLM Serving**

Standard round-robin load balancing is structurally unsuited for LLM serving.5 Request latency in auto-regressive decoding is determined by two factors: prompt length (prefill phase) and generated sequence length (decode phase).1 A round-robin proxy distributing requests evenly will cause hardware imbalances, where one replica is starved while another experiences memory thrashing.3  
To prevent these conditions, modern balancers implement memory-, cache-, and adapter-aware strategies.

* **Consistent Hashing:** Hashes request parameters (e.g., Tenant ID) to route sequential requests from the same user to the same replica, preserving localized cache affinity.7  
* **Prefix Affinity:** Dynamically routes requests with similar prompt prefixes to the same replica, allowing the engine to reuse prefilled KV states.5  
* **Prefix-Match Hashing:** Tokenizes prompt prefixes and computes a stable hash to assign requests directly to a specific rank.30  
* **Precise Cache-Aware Routing:** Monitored by the load balancer, this tracks physical cache allocations inside GPU memory to route requests to the warmest node.23  
* **Adapter-Aware Dispatch:** Tracks loaded LoRA adapter states to target nodes that already contain the requested adapter in memory, avoiding cold-start load delays.3  
* **Late-Binding Flow Control:** Holds requests in a centralized queue, delaying routing decisions until the last possible millisecond when a downstream slot is verified free.24

#### **The Physics of Prefix Caching**

Prefix-aware load balancing leverages the fact that many LLM workloads share identical system instructions, few-shot examples, or conversation histories.16 Runtimes like SGLang and vLLM organize active physical blocks into a global radix tree or hash table, caching the activations of previously computed prompts.16 If a request lands on a replica containing matching cached blocks, it can skip the expensive, compute-bound prefill phase entirely, reducing Time to First Token (TTFT) by multiple orders of magnitude.5  
The radix tree minimizes memory footprints by ensuring that memory consumption scales with unique content rather than total processed tokens.36  
Without Caching: 3 requests x 1000 tokens = 3000 tokens in HBM 36  
With Caching: 800 shared tokens + (3 requests x 200 unique tokens) = 1400 tokens (approximately 53% savings) 36

#### **Hashing and Key Extraction**

To achieve high-efficiency caching, load balancers must route requests sharing prefixes to the exact same GPU replica.30 SGLang implements the prefix_match load balancing strategy, which tokenizes input sequences and computes a blake2b hash across a 256-token window, routing the request to a specific data-parallel (DP) rank 30:  
Target DP Rank = hash(head) % dp_size 30  
This mathematical mapping delivers a 5.7x reduction in TTFT under sequential multi-turn workloads compared to default round-robin policies.30  
To extract a stable routing key without evaluating the entire dynamic conversation history, which shifts on every turn and would route follow-up turns to cold nodes, proxies employ a fast, probabilistic heuristic.5 The proxy extracts the target model name, allocates a strict character budget, and parses only the **system prompt** and the **first user turn** 5:  
Routing Key = Extract(System Prompt[0..256] |  
| User Turn 1[0..256]) 5  
By ignoring subsequent turns, the routing key remains perfectly stable across the entire lifetime of the session, pinning the conversation to the GPU holding the warm KV cache blocks.5

#### **Prefill-Decode Disaggregation**

When serving heavy workloads, processing prompts (prefills) and generating tokens (decodes) on the same GPU can degrade performance.21 Prefills are compute-bound, saturating FLOPS; decodes are memory-bound, bottlenecked by memory bandwidth.11 Interleaving them on a single node causes head-of-line blocking and latency spikes.21  
Disaggregating these phases onto dedicated prefill and decode pools isolates execution.11 In a disaggregated deployment, a proxy coordinates the multi-step request flow: it dispatches the prompt to a prefill worker, waits for completion, transfers the resulting KV cache to a decode worker, and streams the generated tokens back to the client.21

| Doctrine: prefill is compute-bound; decode is memory-bandwidth-bound. Disaggregation improves   |
| throughput only when KV transfer and decode-side preallocation are cheaper than mixed-node      |
| head-of-line blocking.                                                                          |

To support disaggregated execution, SGLang manages specialized queues across prefill and decode instances.12

* **Prefill Instance Lifecycles:** Incoming requests enter the *Bootstrap Queue* to execute handshakes and pre-allocate memory on the decode node.12 They transition to the *Waiting Queue* to execute the compute-intensive prefill forward pass.12 Finally, they enter the *Inflight Queue*, where a non-blocking poll monitors the transfer status until the KV cache is fully transmitted to the decoder.12  
* **Decode Instance Lifecycles:** Requests enter the *Prealloc Queue* to initialize the receiver and pre-allocate physical KV blocks.12 They move to the *Transfer Queue* to poll the receiver until weight ingestion is complete.12 Once verified, requests land in the *Waiting Queue* to build a metadata batch that skips the prefill pass, and finally merge into the *Running Batch* for uninterrupted autoregressive token generation.12

These transfers run on high-performance backends like Mooncake (an RDMA-based transfer engine optimized for InfiniBand/RoCE) or NIXL (a UCX/libfabric plugin system).12 In write mode, the proxy dispatches to prefill and decode concurrently; the prefill node pushes the KV cache layer-by-layer directly into the decoder’s pre-allocated memory via RDMA writes as each layer is computed, minimizing transfer overhead.21  
Large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) deployments (e.g., DeepSeek-V3/R1) combine prefill-decode disaggregation with Wide Expert Parallelism (WideEP).42 These workloads rely on optimized collective communication kernels like DeepEP to handle expert-to-expert token routing, dual-batch overlap (DBO) to mask MoE dispatch overheads, and Expert Parallel Load Balancing (EPLB) weight shuffles to balance token routing skew across physical GPUs.42

## **Tenant-Aware Capacity & Architectural Isolation**

Multi-tenant enterprise serving architectures must protect hardware pools from the noisy-neighbor problem, where a single high-volume customer saturates shared GPU batch slots.2

| Doctrine: tenant isolation starts at the gateway but does not end there. Logical quotas prevent    |

* **Opaque Key Verification:** Resolves tenant identity at the gateway using hashed keys, matching requests to billing plans and routing tables.  
* **Token-Bucket Limits:** Enforces usage limits using Redis-backed sorted sets, preventing extreme token or request spikes.  
* **Weighted Fair Queues:** Sorts requests by priority and tenant tier, guaranteeing that premium users bypass background processing queues.2  
* **CUDA MPS Allocation:** Logically partitions GPU Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and memory limits, ensuring that tenant containers run isolated on shared hardware.2  
* **MIG Partitioning:** Provides physical, hardware-level isolation by partitioning the GPU silicon and memory bus into distinct, independent instances.10  
* **PCIe-Aware Placement:** Tracks host-level link contention, dynamically migrating active processes across physical cards to avoid PCIe bus hotspots.10

#### **Atomic Token-Locking to Prevent TOCTOU Races**

To prevent Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions in high-concurrency environments, where multiple parallel requests might read a tenant’s active slot count before the database writes the increment, systems utilize atomic Redis Lua scripts :

```Lua  
-- Lua script for acquiring a concurrency slot  
local key = KEYS  
local limit = tonumber(ARGV)  
local ttl = tonumber(ARGV)

local current = tonumber(redis.call('get', key) or "0")  
if current < limit then  
    redis.call('incr', key)  
    if current == 0 then  
        redis.call('expire', key, ttl)  
    end  
    return 1 -- Slot acquired  
else  
    return 0 -- Limit exceeded  
end
```

By packaging the check and the increment into a single atomic operation, the proxy guarantees that no tenant can bypass concurrency limits during burst events.

#### **Hardware Isolation: MIG, MPS, and PCIe Contention**

While logical separation at the proxy protects queuing layers, heavy workloads can degrade performance at the physical layer.10 When multiple containers run concurrently on a shared GPU, they can trigger resource contention along the shared Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) fabric and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) domains, causing tail latency spikes and SLO violations.10  
To achieve deterministic execution, systems implement physical hardware isolation strategies:

* **Multi-Instance GPU (MIG):** Physically partitions the GPU silicon, HBM memory, and internal paths into distinct hardware instances.10 While MIG provides absolute compute and memory isolation, it does not isolate the shared PCIe bus, meaning intensive data transfers from background jobs can still bottleneck latency-sensitive inference runs.10  
* **Multi-Process Service (MPS):** Provides logical, software-level partitioning of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and memory limits.2 It is highly dynamic but offers weaker physical isolation than MIG.25  
* **PCIe-Aware Placement:** A host-level controller monitors tail latencies and PCIe bandwidth usage in a real-time feedback loop.10 If a tenant’s p99 latency exceeds its Service Level Objective (SLO), the controller migrates processes across physical cards, pinning process affinities away from IRQ-heavy host CPU cores and busy PCIe root switches.25 Combined with dynamic MIG reconfiguration and cgroup disk limits (io.max throttles), this optimization reduces SLO miss rates by approximately 32% and improves p99 TTFT tails by up to 15% under heavy I/O contention.10

## **Backpressure, Admission Control, and Quota Management**

When request volume outpaces available hardware capacity, model serving architectures must implement backpressure to protect GPUs from catastrophic failures and memory exhaustion.3 Admission control shifts the burden of queuing from the isolated model servers to the gateway.24

### **Backpressure and Admission Control Framework**

| Backpressure Strategy | Triggering Condition | Technical Implementation | Downstream Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Request Shedding** | Gateway queues or target backend pools exceed maximum wait times.3 | Rejects incoming requests immediately with an HTTP 503 error.3 | Drops low-priority traffic to protect active interactive streams.3 |
| **Priority Queuing** | Active backend pools report high HBM cache pressure.24 | Re-orders requests in the proxy plane using fair-share queues.24 | Automatically pauses background jobs during interactive traffic peaks.24 |
| **Constraint Clipping** | Incoming prompt lengths exceed target context windows.9 | Rejects payloads or truncates prompts before HBM allocation.8 | Avoids out-of-memory (OOM) failures on physical nodes.8 |
| **Automatic Downgrade** | Primary model execution fails or reports high queue latencies.8 | Redirects the active request stream to a smaller model replica.8 | Retries with a faster, cheaper local model to preserve availability.8 |
| **Async Deferral** | Saturated queues during peak interactive usage.3 | Bypasses the synchronous path; pushes payloads to an offline queue.3 | Delays batch processing to guarantee low latency for active users.3 |
| **Fail-Closed Path** | Detected security risks, template drift, or PII leaks.8 | Abruptly terminates the active execution thread and logs the error.8 | Blocks execution; returns a standardized HTTP 400 error. |

To enforce usage policies, platforms deploy rate limiters that track requests and dynamic execution metrics.

* **Requests Per Minute (RPM):** Monitored per tenant using sliding-window Redis sorted sets, rejecting bursts exceeding plans.  
* **Tokens Per Minute (TPM):** Tracks processed input and generated output tokens, soft-rejecting requests when limits are hit.  
* **Concurrent Requests:** Caps in-flight requests per user, holding excess calls in central queues to prevent thread exhaustion.  
* **Agent Recursion Limits:** Caps maximum sequential steps and tool executions inside agentic loops, halting runaway processes.  
* **Budget Ceilings:** Tracks calculated dollar costs per query, enforcing hard stops when monthly or daily spending limits are reached.

When backend systems are overloaded, poorly configured clients can trigger retry storms, compounding system pressure.28 To mitigate this risk, gateways enforce exponential backoff with randomized jitter and deploy circuit breakers that temporarily stop routing traffic to degraded zones, allowing them to recover.6

## **Elastic Scaling & Cold-Start Optimization**

Autoscaling for GPU workloads differs fundamentally from CPU-based services.9 While standard Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) trigger on CPU or system memory footprints, GPU runtimes saturate execution cores while keeping CPU metrics low, meaning CPU-based scaling fails to react before users experience massive latency spikes.9  
Autoscalers must evaluate GPU-native signals to scale capacity proactively.

### **Autoscaling and Cold-Start Model**

| Scaling Phase | Primary Metrics | Technical Execution | Latency Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Metric Extraction** | vllm:num_requests_waiting and gpu_cache_usage_perc.9 | Scrapes Prometheus-format endpoints via DCGM and engine monitors.9 | Proactively triggers scale actions before queue saturation degrades TTFT.9 |
| **Node Provisioning** | Compute resource requests and pending replica counts.7 | Karpenter on EKS provisions new GPU nodes in ~60 seconds.9 | Introduces structural lag; requires pre-allocated warm pools to buffer spikes.9 |
| **Weight Loading** | Weights size and network bandwidth availability.8 | Fetches model files from local registries; skips remote CDN retrievals.8 | Eliminates variable WAN download latencies; guarantees fast weight transfers.8 |
| **Runtime Init** | CUDA memory allocation and library load states.43 | Mounts images, loads models, and initializes the CUDA runtime.43 | Takes 10–30 seconds to initialize complex libraries. |
| **Optimized Capture** | Kernel compilation and CUDA graph capture steps.26 | Skip compilation with --enforce-eager or load templates via Foundry.26 | Cuts cold-start compilation overhead from minutes to under 4 seconds.26 |
| **Route Registration** | Host-level health-check passing states.6 | Verifies server readiness via mock runs before updating router tables.6 | Verifies node health before exposing it to active traffic.8 |

To protect users from cold-start latencies, architectures implement model residency strategies that map models to warm, on-demand, or batch tiers.

```

To optimize serverless cold starts, runtimes trade peak execution performance for fast startup times.43 For example, launching vLLM with the --enforce-eager flag skips time-consuming compiler optimizations and CUDA graph captures, reducing cold starts from 460 seconds to 219 seconds.43  
For massive deployments, context materialization platforms (such as Foundry) persist compiled execution templates and GPU state layouts offline, restoring them during scale-up to cut the initialization time of a 235B parameter MoE model from 10 minutes to 3.9 seconds.26 Some platforms also utilize snapshot-restore features, freezing a warmed GPU instance to disk and restoring its memory state on demand to bypass the initialization path entirely.43

## **Deployment Topologies: Cloud, On-Prem, Edge, Local, and Hybrid**

Selecting a deployment topology requires balancing tradeoffs across compliance, latency, cost, and maintenance complexity. The topology matrix below details these architectural options.

### **Deployment Topology Matrix**

| Topology | Capability Access | Latency Footprint | Operational Complexity | Cost Economics | Failure Modes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Managed APIs** | Immediate access to state-of-the-art frontier models.4 | High variability; vulnerable to WAN network jitter and rate limits.1 | Lowest; vendor manages scaling and infrastructure.4 | Pay-per-token pricing; expensive at sustained volumes.4 | Provider outages, quiet version updates, and pricing shifts.4 |
| **Cloud Self-Hosted** | High; deploy any custom-trained open weights.4 | Lowest latency via dedicated GPU nodes.9 | High; requires cluster scheduling and engineering.9 | Fixed hourly GPU costs; cheap at high, sustained usage.4 | Memory leaks, OOM crashes, and capacity provisioning delays.8 |
| **Private Cloud** | Custom limits based on internal hardware. | Low; constrained by localized interconnects. | Very High; requires dedicated system admins. | Capital expenditure model; high upfront costs. | Internal network congestion and hardware component failures. |
| **On-Premise** | Absolute control; custom model architectures. | Sub-millisecond localized execution. | Highest; team manages hardware lifecycle. | Maximum upfront CAPEX; zero recurring cloud fees. | Physical cooling faults and local power interruptions. |
| **Edge Deployment** | Constrained to small model footprints.4 | Deterministic localized latency. | High; sync configurations across distributed fleets. | Lowest; uses local client compute resources. | Local memory limits and update sync failures. |
| **Hybrid Systems** | Flexible model selection across pools.4 | Dynamic; route dependent.4 | High; requires unified gateways and routers.18 | Optimized; balances cheap local with costly remote.4 | Routing regressions and cascading failures.4 |

## **High Availability, Failover, and Degraded Modes**

Architectures must isolate failures proactively to preserve user-facing SLAs.8 If a component degrades, the serving platform must transition traffic immediately to healthy backups.27

### **High-Availability and Failover Model**

| Component | Primary Failure Mode | Immediate Detection Vector | Failover Strategy | Recovery Execution |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Inference Server** | GPU out-of-memory (OOM) error.8 | DCGM memory metric spikes; SIGSEGV exit codes.8 | Tripping circuit breakers on the proxy plane.6 | Restarts container; routes active queue to backup pool.27 |
| **Model Registry** | Network timeout during weight retrieval.8 | Failed file system mounts and checksum mismatch alerts.8 | Fallback to warm snapshot images.8 | Deploys preceding stable SHA image version.8 |
| **Model Router** | Input text classification timeout.22 | Upstream gateway request timeouts.6 | Bypasses classifier; applies default static route.4 | Restarts classifier pod; updates routing registry. |
| **Load Balancer** | Loss of cache affinity telemetry paths.23 | Empty metrics scraped from target backends.3 | Falls back to standard round-robin or least-loaded.30 | Resyncs endpoint cache states using state files.23 |
| **API Gateway** | Complete edge-to-cloud path disconnect.27 | Downstream connection drops; client timeout spikes.27 | Routes traffic to geo-redundant secondary region.27 | Re-establishes DNS paths once primary region is stable.27 |
| **Telemetry Collector** | Shared buffer memory pool exhaustion.3 | Rising packet drops reported by telemetry agents.3 | Drops telemetry traces locally to protect compute.3 | Spasms collector pods; drains queued logs. |

When capacity is severely constrained, platforms transition to degraded serving states to preserve essential user-facing features.

## **Serving Observability and Operations**

Observability in model serving must look beyond host-level CPU and memory footprints.3 Trace records must connect physical hardware performance back to active model versions and tenant identities, allowing SREs to isolate regressions instantly.1

This tracking model maps failures to their root causes, identifying bottlenecks across the stack.

### **Serving Failure Mode Map**

| Failure Scenario | Root Cause Mechanism | Immediate System Metric Impact | Operational Remediation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cold-Start Storm** | Concurrent node scale-ups download heavy weights.26 | Karpenter provisioning spike; TTFT > 60s.9 | Restores from warm snapshots or Foundry templates.26 |
| **GPU OOM Crash** | Processing prompts with long context outliers.8 | gpu_memory_utilization_perc drops to 0%.9 | Restarts container; lowers static cache fraction.27 |
| **Cache Leakage** | Shared memory addresses leak data across sessions. | High cross-tenant request metrics on identical nodes. | Isolates and partitions cache keys per tenant. |
| **Queue Saturation** | Traffic spikes exceed target execution slots.24 | Waiting request count spikes on prometheus endpoints.9 | Enforces rate limits; sheds low-priority traffic.3 |
| **Telemetry Drop** | Intensive logging saturates network buffers.15 | Packet loss; missing clickhouse database records.15 | Limits tracing overhead; decouples collection threads. |
| **MIG Fragmentation** | Mismatched node profiles block scheduling.51 | GPU replicas sit in permanent pending status.7 | Re-allocates templates; reconfigures GPU groupings.25 |

To maintain system reliability, SREs deploy automated runbooks to detect and resolve runtime anomalies before they violate SLAs.

## **Core Doctrinal Principles**

To conclude this research report, the operational tenets of model serving architecture are synthesized into seven durable engineering principles.

### **I. Model Serving is Traffic Governance, Not Simple Hosting**

The serving stack must act as an intelligent gateway, managing requests across validation, security, and resource boundaries before allocating hardware cycles.1 Exposing raw inference endpoints directly to application consumers bypasses capacity management and risks system-wide cascades.2

### **II. Decouple the Control Plane from the Data Plane**

Changes to routing rules, deployment weights, tenant allocations, and fallback configurations must execute declaratively in the control plane.19 The data plane must focus exclusively on low-latency request execution, using zero-copy pipelines and stable metadata lookups to ensure high-performance streaming.5

### **III. Route Requests via Token and Memory Locality**

LLM serving is stateful by nature; the physical GPU hosting the warm KV cache is the most efficient execution target.5 Load balancers must route requests by analyzing tokenized prefix hashes, utilizing precise cache-state telemetry to avoid redundant prefill passes.23

### **IV. Enforce Multi-Tenant Isolation Down to the Silicon Layer**

Logical rate-limiting at the proxy is insufficient for heavy enterprise serving workloads.2 Platform teams must implement physical hardware partition boundaries, using MPS, MIG, and PCIe-aware process affinity placement to prevent cross-tenant performance interference and tail-latency degradation.10

### **V. Queue Centrally and Bind Late**

Holding requests centrally inside the load balancing plane avoids "scheduling regret," preventing high-priority tasks from getting stuck behind lower-tier requests in localized model queues.24 This delay allows the gateway to dispatch requests to the optimal replica at the last possible millisecond.24

### **VI. Proactive Autoscaling Demands GPU-Native Metrics**

Standard CPU and system memory footprint monitors fail to predict GPU compute bottlenecks.9 Platform operators must scale clusters based on model-specific parameters—such as waiting request queues and active HBM occupancy—to scale reactively before users experience latency spikes.9

### **VII. Plan for Degraded Grace over Absolute Failure**

In high-dimensional serving environments, network drops, hardware faults, and budget exhaustion are inevitable.27 Serving platforms must map detailed fallback routes, dynamic model downgrades, and cached response states to maintain availability even during partial outages.4
