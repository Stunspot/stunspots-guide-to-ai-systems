# AI-ENG-L — Model Serving Architecture - Routing, Load Balancing & Deployment Topologies

## **Doctrinal Paradigm: Traffic Governance for Probabilistic Compute**

Model serving in production enterprise systems represents a paradigm shift from hosting deterministic microservices to governing traffic across probabilistic compute pipelines.1 Traditional web serving assumes static request-response lifetimes, uniform resource footprints, and simple CPU or system memory bottlenecks.1 In contrast, serving architecture for large language models (LLMs) and foundation models must manage highly variable request processing times, dynamic memory footprints inside the High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) of graphics processing units (GPUs), and complex operational dependencies.1  

The core operational doctrine of this report dictates that:  

> *Serving architecture is traffic governance for probabilistic compute: route each request to the cheapest sufficient, authorized, available, latency-appropriate model path while preserving isolation, reliability, observability, and rollback.4*  

Treating model serving as merely hosting a weight checkpoint behind an endpoint ignores the operational realities of hardware scarcity, variable context lengths, and tenant-level resource contention.1 The useful question is not "Where is the model hosted?" but "How does each request move through gateway, authentication, tenant policy, routing, queueing, cache, inference execution, validation, fallback, telemetry, and rollback under real production constraints?".4  
This architectural paradigm requires a decoupled design divided into a control plane and a data plane:

* **The Control Plane:** Manages configuration states, release pipelines, routing topologies, tenant quota definitions, scale targets, safety policies, and model metadata registries. It handles the declarative definition of model-serving environments, enabling operators to modify routing rules or adjust capacity allocations without rebuilding execution containers or disrupting live connections.  

* **The Data Plane:** Executes in the direct path of user requests. It performs request admission, tokenizes incoming prompts, extracts routing keys, queries cache states, schedules iteration-level batches, coordinates KV cache transfers, executes model inference on raw hardware, validates output structures, streams responses, and pumps telemetry events to collectors.2

By segregating these concerns, platform engineers can update routing heuristics, hot-swap model versions, scale capacity pools dynamically, and isolate tenant-level anomalies without introducing downtime or risking structural regressions inside the physical execution layer.2  

This report closes Volume 4: Runtime Architecture and Inference Mechanics, whose concern is how AI systems execute under physical, computational, and operational constraints. AI-ENG-J established throughput mechanics: prefill, decode, KV cache, batching, queueing, cache pressure, memory pressure, and capacity margins. AI-ENG-K established weight dynamics and decoding strategy: quantization, compression, speculative decoding, constrained decoding, sampling policies, kernel compatibility, and behavior-preserving optimization. AI-ENG-L now defines how inference capacity is deployed, exposed, routed, scaled, protected, and recovered in production.  

This report draws clean boundaries. AI-ENG-J owns the physical mechanics inside inference execution. AI-ENG-K owns numerical representation, compression, and decoding optimization. AI-ENG-L owns the serving topology around those engines: gateways, routers, load balancers, inference servers, model residency, local, edge, or cloud deployment, tenant-aware capacity, queues, autoscaling, cold starts, rate limits, backpressure, failover, high availability, and degraded serving patterns.4

## **Conceptual Glossary**

To ensure structural durability for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and establish a rigorous baseline for platform engineering, this section defines the core components of high-dimensional serving architectures.

| Term | Architectural Definition | Operational Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Model Serving Architecture** | The control and data plane coordination layers that expose inference capacity to clients while managing system resources.6 | Governs how requests traverse physical networks to reach optimized, validated hardware partitions.13 |
| **Inference Server** | A specialized runtime engine that loads model weights, manages physical GPU memory, batches requests, and executes optimized compute kernels.14 | Directly interfaces with hardware via runtimes like vLLM, SGLang, and Triton.15 |
| **Model Gateway** | An intelligent proxy plane that centralizes model routing, tokenization, tracking, and telemetry.6 | Acts as a unified entrypoint for upstream client requests, decoupling application logic from backend runtimes.6 |
| **API Gateway** | An edge proxy that handles external client ingress, transport-layer security (TLS), global authentication, and rate-limiting.8 | Acts as the first line of defense, validating incoming HTTP/gRPC requests before forwarding them.19 |
| **Control Plane** | The system layer that manages declarative configurations, release manifests, and routing topologies.13 | Syncs state updates across the fleet asynchronously without interrupting the active request-handling path.13 |
| **Data Plane** | The execution path that tokenizes prompts, manages physical KV caches, executes model kernels, and streams tokens.6 | Operates under strict latency constraints (milliseconds) to handle live inference traffic.17 |
| **Routing Policy** | A behavioral configuration defining the rules that match a request context to a target model endpoint.4 | Maps incoming prompts to the most cost-effective, high-performing model path.4 |
| **Model Portfolio** | The heterogeneous collection of active models, quantization formats, and specialized task adapters.3 | Enables cost-performance optimization by matching tasks to tailored, specialized model tiers.3 |
| **Load Balancing** | Memory-, cache-, and tenant-aware traffic distribution across homogeneous or heterogeneous GPU replicas.1 | Prevents resource imbalances and avoids premature evictions of hot prefix caches.23 |
| **Tenant-Aware Capacity** | The logical or physical partitioning of model execution resources based on tenant identity and priority.2 | Prevents high-volume tenants from starving others of HBM slots or queuing capacity.2 |
| **Admission Control** | The gateway-level mechanism that intercepts, queues, or rejects incoming traffic based on active system saturation.3 | Protects physical GPU clusters from thrashing and memory exhaustion during traffic spikes.3 |
| **Backpressure** | Controlled resistance applied to upstream clients (e.g., HTTP 429 errors or queue delays) when system limits are reached.2 | Prevents the serving cluster from collapsing under unexpected or bursty workloads.24 |
| **Autoscaling** | The elastic provisioning of model replicas and physical GPU nodes based on live queue depth and cache saturation.7 | Automatically adjusts system capacity to match incoming load while minimizing idle hardware costs.9 |
| **Cold Start** | The latency delay incurred when provisioning a new replica, downloading weights, and compiling GPU kernels.8 | Can span minutes, requiring active mitigations to protect user-facing latency SLAs.9 |
| **Model Residency** | The operational state determining whether model weights are kept warm in VRAM, cached on SSD, or stored in cold registries.8 | Governs the tradeoff between immediate latency availability and active hardware memory footprints.8 |
| **Rate Limit** | A resource-aware safety ceiling capping requests, tokens, or concurrency metrics per unit of time. | Enforces usage policies and protects backend infrastructure from runaway client loops. |
| **Quota** | A contract-level budget defining the maximum allowable consumption (e.g., total tokens or spend limits) over long intervals. | Governs tenant-level entitlement limits for billing, budget enforcement, and cost controls. |
| **Fallback Route** | An alternative model or execution path automatically triggered when the primary route degrades or fails.8 | Guarantees continuous service availability during provider outages or local hardware failures.27 |
| **Degraded Mode** | A resilient operating state that serves lower-fidelity responses or limits features when resources are constrained.8 | Preserves basic user functionality and system trust rather than returning abrupt error states.8 |
| **High Availability** | The architectural design that minimizes downtime through replica redundancy, health checks, and automatic failovers.6 | Guarantees continuous platform access across hardware failures, zone drops, and cloud outages.6 |
| **Failover** | The automated routing transition that shifts active traffic from an unhealthy component to a healthy backup.27 | Isolates hardware and network anomalies instantly to preserve user-facing SLAs.27 |
| **Serving Trace** | A distributed log mapping a request's journey across gateways, routers, caches, and execution runtimes.6 | Enables regression audits, security forensic analysis, and granular tenant cost attribution.8 |

## **Serving Stack Reference Architecture**

A robust serving platform must orchestrate multiple software and hardware layers to deliver deterministic SLAs on top of non-deterministic model engines. The reference architecture diagram below traces the path of a client request down to physical GPU clusters.

### **Serving Stack Layer Matrix**

| Layer | Primary Responsibility | Representative Technologies | Fail-Safe Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Gateway / Ingress** | Handles client ingress, transport-layer security termination, global rate-limiting, request logging, and corporate SSO integration. | Kong, Envoy, Istio Ingress, AWS API Gateway. | Fails closed on authentication failures and returns a clean authorization error. |
| **Tenant Policy Engine** | Validates API keys, extracts tenant context, resolves entitlement, and enforces quotas, RPM, TPM, concurrency, budget, and model-access limits. | Custom API proxy, Redis Cluster, durable quota ledger, policy store. | Fails closed when tenant identity or policy state cannot be verified. Downgrades only when identity is valid and policy explicitly permits a lower-tier route. |
| **Request Classification** | Inspects request payloads to identify modality, language, task class, context length, schema needs, risk level, and latency target. | ModernBERT classifiers, lightweight transformer sidecars, rules engines. | Defaults to a conservative standard route for low-risk requests; high-risk or policy-sensitive requests fail closed or route to human review. |
| **Model Router** | Evaluates the model portfolio to determine the optimal endpoint based on task difficulty, risk, latency, cost, tenant policy, fallback state, and route availability. | SGLang Model Gateway, RouteLLM, Not Diamond, LiteLLM, custom routers. | Defaults to a configured tenant-approved safe baseline route. High-risk or policy-sensitive requests fail closed rather than silently escalating to an unapproved frontier or external provider. |
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes requests based on queue depth, cache warmth, adapter residency, HBM pressure, tenant fairness, and prefix affinity. | Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension, llm-d, sgl-router, custom dispatchers. | Falls back to least-loaded or round-robin only when cache-affinity telemetry is unavailable and route safety remains intact. |
| **Queue / Admission Layer** | Buffers incoming requests, enforces priority scheduling, applies backpressure, and protects backend runtimes from saturation. | Endpoint Proxy Plane flow control, Redis-backed priority queues, custom admission controllers. | Rejects or defers low-priority work with clean HTTP 429/503 responses during peaks. |
| **Cache Layers** | Performs semantic caching, prompt caching, prefix tracking, and cache telemetry while preserving tenant and permission boundaries. | Redis Enterprise, Milvus, SGLang RadixCache, vLLM prefix cache. | Bypasses caching when safety, freshness, or authorization checks fail. Never serves cross-tenant or stale cache entries. |
| **Inference Servers** | Loads model weights, manages KV cache memory, schedules continuous batches, executes optimized kernels, streams tokens, and emits runtime metrics. | vLLM, SGLang Runtime, Triton Inference Server, TensorRT-LLM. | Triggers preemption, recomputation, swap, degraded routing, or circuit breaking depending on failure type. |
| **Model Registry** | Stores and distributes version-pinned, SHA-validated, immutable model artifacts and metadata. | Unity Catalog, MLflow Registry, OCI artifact stores, custom registries. | Halts deployment and rolls back to the preceding SHA-validated active artifact. |
| **Artifact Store** | Stores high-capacity weight checkpoints, quantized variants, adapter files, tokenizer bundles, templates, and startup snapshots. | AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, local SAN, OCI registries. | Blocks initialization on checksum mismatch or timeout; alerts operators and preserves prior active route. |
| **Retrieval / Tool Sidecars** | Coordinates retrieval calls, MCP/API tools, embedding stores, document fetches, and external functional dependencies. | Ray Serve applications, Composio MCP gateways, vector DB clients, tool gateways. | Disables affected tools or routes to direct-answer fallback when tool dependencies are unavailable. |
| **Validators** | Verifies structural output conformance, safety policy, tool arguments, grounding, and action readiness. | Guardrails AI, LlamaGuard, schema validators, custom policy checks. | Retries, escalates, downgrades, or fails closed depending on risk class and validation failure type. |
| **Telemetry** | Collects logs, traces, Prometheus metrics, audit-critical execution metadata, GPU metrics, cost records, and failure signals. | OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Datadog Agent, ClickHouse, DCGM. | Continues serving only if safety and audit requirements remain satisfied; samples or drops noncritical telemetry, raises alerts, and preserves audit-critical traces. |
| **Fallback Controller** | Coordinates backup routes, degraded modes, provider failover, model downgrade, and retry boundaries. | LiteLLM proxy, custom gateway interceptor, circuit breakers, route policy engine. | Returns standardized degraded-service responses when no safe fallback path remains. |
| **Rollback Controller** | Automates traffic shifts, rollback of model versions, canary aborts, route freezing, and recovery verification. | GitOps controllers, ArgoCD, custom Kubernetes operators, release controllers. | Freezes routing state, blocks new deployments, and restores the last known-good release manifest. |

### **Control Plane / Data Plane Coordination Model**

The control plane and data plane must remain semantically synchronized through versioned snapshots while staying operationally decoupled from request execution. Routing policies, tenant quotas, release manifests, fallback states, safety policies, and autoscaling targets should propagate into the data plane through explicit configuration versions, not live blocking lookups.

The data plane must be able to continue serving with the last known-good configuration if the control plane becomes slow or temporarily unavailable. Control-plane failure should never force live request execution to wait on configuration databases, registry lookups, or policy-management services.

| System Aspect | Control Plane Responsibilities | Data Plane Responsibilities | Coordination & Sync Mechanisms |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Configuration & Routing** | Defines target models, route matrices, static rules, semantic-routing policies, fallback paths, and canary split percentages. | Tokenizes prompts, extracts routing keys, evaluates local route snapshots, and dispatches to selected nodes. | Versioned routing snapshots streamed asynchronously through xDS, config maps, or gateway control channels. |
| **Tenant Quotas** | Manages tenant tiers, contract budgets, data residency, model entitlements, spend ceilings, and rate-limit policy. | Enforces RPM, TPM, concurrency, budget, and per-workflow execution limits during request admission. | Distributed counters and policy caches, such as Redis plus durable billing ledger reconciliation. |
| **Release Management** | Publishes release manifests, approves canaries, validates SHA-pinned artifacts, and controls progressive rollout percentages. | Applies canary splits, selects active model versions, records manifest IDs, and routes traffic to warm instances. | Immutable release manifests synchronized to the gateway and inference-serving layers before traffic shift. |
| **Autoscaling** | Computes desired capacity from queue depth, p95/p99 latency, HBM pressure, cache saturation, and forecasted load. | Reports queue depth, preemption, free-block count, active batch size, HBM occupancy, and cold-start readiness. | Prometheus/DCGM metrics feeding KEDA, Karpenter, Kubernetes controllers, or custom GPU autoscalers. |
| **Rollback & Failover** | Declares unhealthy routes, freezes deployments, selects previous stable manifests, and defines recovery criteria. | Trips circuit breakers, shifts traffic, activates degraded paths, and preserves request traces during failover. | Health probes, route-state snapshots, incident runbooks, and automated rollback controllers. |
| **Safety & Compliance** | Defines regulated-route policy, high-risk workflow rules, human-review requirements, and data-residency boundaries. | Enforces local routing decisions, fail-closed behavior, validation gates, and tenant-isolated execution boundaries. | Versioned policy bundles and audit-backed route approvals distributed to gateway and validator layers. |
| **Telemetry & Audit** | Defines required trace fields, retention policy, audit-critical metadata, and incident evidence requirements. | Emits route decisions, model SHAs, prompt hashes, cache state, validation results, fallback events, and cost records. | OpenTelemetry traces, structured logs, metrics stores, cost ledgers, and replayable serving records. |

The essential rule is simple: the control plane defines what is allowed and desired; the data plane executes what is currently authorized and safe. Configuration freshness matters, but request execution must not block on control-plane availability.

## **Inference Server Layer Mechanics & Compatibility Gates**

The base engine of the serving architecture is the inference server. It abstracts raw GPU hardware, exposing a programmatic API while managing memory layouts, continuous batch schedules, and execution optimization.  
The responsibilities of the inference server are:

* **Model Loading and Weight Fetching:** Server engines must fetch, cache, and mount model weights.8 To avoid third-party CDN dependencies during container startups, optimized platforms pull weights from local, immutable OCI-compliant registries.8  
* **Request Scheduling and Batching:** Static batching is unusable in conversational applications due to high variance in output generation lifetimes.32 Modern runtimes execute continuous, iteration-level batching, where completed sequences are evicted and waiting requests are scheduled at the boundary of each individual token step.32  
* **Memory Management (Paged KV Cache):** To prevent memory fragmentation, engines partition key-value attention tensors into logical blocks.17 These are dynamically mapped to non-contiguous physical memory locations inside GPU HBM via lookup tables, mimicking virtual memory in operating systems.17  
* **Adapter and Multi-Model Support:** Runtimes must host a single base model while dynamically mapping Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters into active HBM space, ensuring adapter-specific routing without weight replication overhead.3  
* **Telemetry and Hook Points:** The engine must expose granular metrics (e.g., Time to First Token, Inter-Token Latency, HBM Cache occupancy) and support intermediate tensor inspection hooks for downstream validation processes.3

To evaluate how different platforms satisfy these core capabilities, engineers must analyze their architectural execution models.

### **Inference Server Architectural Responsibility Comparison**

Inference servers differ in how they load model artifacts, schedule batches, manage KV cache memory, support adapters, expose telemetry, and fit into broader serving topologies. Platform teams should evaluate these engines not as interchangeable HTTP endpoints, but as runtime systems with distinct memory, scheduling, compilation, and observability behaviors.

| Serving Engine | Weight Loading & Lifecycle | Batch Scheduling Model | Memory Management / KV Cache | Adapter & Multi-Model Support | Telemetry & Observability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **vLLM** | Loads models from local disk, Hugging Face, or artifact stores; supports SHA-pinned deployment workflows. | Continuous, iteration-level batch scheduling with preemption, recompute, and swap mechanisms. | PagedAttention maps logical KV blocks to non-contiguous physical HBM blocks. | Supports LoRA and multi-LoRA serving patterns depending on runtime configuration. | Exposes Prometheus metrics for TTFT, ITL, queue state, cache usage, throughput, and runtime pressure. |
| **SGLang** | Loads model artifacts through runtime workers; supports OpenAI-compatible serving, structured generation, distributed serving, and high-throughput execution paths. | High-performance scheduling optimized for decode-heavy workloads, prefix reuse, and structured generation. | RadixAttention tracks and caches shared prompt prefixes in an active radix tree, reducing redundant prefill work. | Supports adapters and multi-model serving patterns, with prefix-aware routing and cache-locality considerations. | Provides metrics for radix cache hit rates, queue status, serving latency, throughput, and runtime health. |
| **TensorRT-LLM** | Compiles models into optimized engines and supports high-performance deployment on NVIDIA hardware. | Uses in-flight batching and optimized execution schedules designed for compiled inference graphs. | Supports paged KV cache and optimized tensor block layouts where configured. | Adapter support depends on engine build, model architecture, and predefined runtime pathways. | Exposes engine execution statistics, GPU metrics, and integration points through NVIDIA tooling. |
| **Triton Inference Server** | Manages explicit model repositories, polling, versioned model loading, and backend lifecycle control. | Supports dynamic batching, sequence batching, ensembles, and backend-specific scheduling. | Delegates memory management to backend runtimes for LLM workloads. | Supports multi-model serving through repository structure and custom backends. | Exposes execution counts, queue latency, inference latency, model errors, and backend metrics. |
| **Ray Serve** | Deploys Python-native serving classes across distributed Ray actors and worker pools. | Uses Ray-level ingress and actor scheduling; can wrap vLLM, SGLang, or custom runtimes. | Delegates KV cache and GPU memory behavior to child inference runtimes. | Manages model multiplexing, actor placement, and distributed application composition. | Provides Ray dashboard telemetry, actor health, request metrics, and application-level traces. |
| **KServe** | Provides Kubernetes-native serving abstractions with raw deployments, serverless modes, and pluggable runtimes. | Relies on underlying serving containers for LLM-specific batching and scheduling. | Delegates KV cache and GPU memory management to target runtime containers. | Supports multi-model serving through pluggable runtimes and deployment patterns. | Integrates with Knative, Istio, Prometheus, and Kubernetes-native monitoring. |

A serving engine should be selected based on the target workload’s dominant constraint: prefix reuse, structured generation, cold-start profile, quantization compatibility, distributed serving, operational simplicity, or maximum hardware efficiency. The correct engine is the one whose runtime behavior matches the workload’s memory, latency, observability, and rollback requirements.

## **Routing Architecture & Multi-Model Orchestration**

A multi-model routing layer transforms an expensive, fragile model cluster into a resilient, cost-efficient utility.4 Most production routing architectures implement a hybrid design: static routing rules process explicit identifiers, semantic routing evaluates prompt intents, and cascading pipelines handle failure recovery.4

```

Task-based and capability-based routing map straightforward requests to low-parameter models, while routing reasoning-heavy tasks to frontier networks.4 Risk-based routing automatically redirects high-stakes workflows (e.g., financial transactions or patient-facing diagnostic requests) to secure, pre-validated local models or human review queues.4  
Modality-based, language-based, and context-length routing evaluate prompt characteristics to match requests to hardware optimized for those targets.4 For example, prompts exceeding 32,000 tokens are routed away from memory-constrained local nodes to high-capacity cloud clusters.11 Tenant-tier and region routing enforce data residency requirements, guaranteeing that sensitive enterprise records remain within compliant geographic boundaries.2  
Cost-aware and latency-aware routing evaluate live metrics to balance execution pricing and speed.4 If the primary model’s queue latency spikes, confidence-based escalation and fallback routing immediately shift traffic to an alternative provider or equivalent open-weight replica.4 When automated tools or reasoning paths fail to return structured outputs, tool-first and human-review routing intercept the request, escalating the output to human administrators to preserve system trust.4  
Evaluating routing strategies requires analyzing their performance and latency overheads.

### **Routing Performance & Latency Matrix**

| Routing Method | Average Latency | Cost Impact | Typical Task | Typical Target Model |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Static Rules** | < 1ms | Fully predictable; zero routing overhead.4 | Structured classification with explicit tags.4 | Quantized 8B parameter model hosted locally.9 |
| **Semantic Routing** | 5-15ms 22 | High savings (60%+) by hitting local cache.28 | Near-duplicate customer support queries.28 | Local embedding similarity lookup with Redis.22 |
| **BERT Classifier** | 10-50ms 22 | Up to 85% cost reduction vs. using GPT-4 alone.29 | General conversational chats on public forums.44 | Fine-tuned 0.5B model classifying prompt difficulty.22 |
| **LLM Classifier** | 200-800ms 22 | Variable; high overhead can negate routing savings.22 | Complex code generation and analysis.44 | Claude Haiku evaluating prompt complexity.4 |
| **Cascading Fallback** | Variable 22 | High latency tax; adds roundtrips on escalations.22 | Multi-step agentic execution workflows.22 | Escalate to Sonnet if Haiku fails validation.4 |
| **Router-R1** | > 1000ms 22 | High; uses extensive reasoning step tokens.22 | Complex mathematical reasoning and proofs.22 | Specialized reasoning model with explicit thinking traces.22 |

A routing decision must be logged with its full context, capturing why alternative paths were rejected.4 If weak routing misclassifies hard tasks or overuses premium models, it can cause cost spikes or degrade system accuracy.4

## **Load Balancing for LLM Serving**

Standard round-robin load balancing is structurally unsuited for LLM serving.5 Request latency in auto-regressive decoding is determined by two factors: prompt length (prefill phase) and generated sequence length (decode phase).1 A round-robin proxy distributing requests evenly will cause hardware imbalances, where one replica is starved while another experiences memory thrashing.3  
To prevent these conditions, modern balancers implement memory-, cache-, and adapter-aware strategies.

* **Consistent Hashing:** Hashes request parameters (e.g., Tenant ID) to route sequential requests from the same user to the same replica, preserving localized cache affinity.7  
* **Prefix Affinity:** Dynamically routes requests with similar prompt prefixes to the same replica, allowing the engine to reuse prefilled KV states.5  
* **Prefix-Match Hashing:** Tokenizes prompt prefixes and computes a stable hash to assign requests directly to a specific rank.30  
* **Precise Cache-Aware Routing:** Monitored by the load balancer, this tracks physical cache allocations inside GPU memory to route requests to the warmest node.23  
* **Adapter-Aware Dispatch:** Tracks loaded LoRA adapter states to target nodes that already contain the requested adapter in memory, avoiding cold-start load delays.3  
* **Late-Binding Flow Control:** Holds requests in a centralized queue, delaying routing decisions until the last possible millisecond when a downstream slot is verified free.24

#### **The Physics of Prefix Caching**

Prefix-aware load balancing leverages the fact that many LLM workloads share identical system instructions, few-shot examples, tool schemas, output contracts, or conversation-history prefixes. Runtimes such as SGLang and vLLM organize reusable prompt states through radix trees, prefix caches, or hash-indexed KV blocks.

If a request lands on a replica containing matching cached prefix blocks, the runtime can skip prefill for the matched prefix and compute prefill only for the unmatched suffix. This reduces Time to First Token (TTFT), lowers redundant compute, and improves GPU utilization without pretending that dynamic user-specific content becomes free.

The radix tree minimizes memory footprint by ensuring that memory consumption scales with unique content rather than total processed tokens.

Example:

```text
Without prefix reuse:

  Request 1: [800 shared tokens][200 unique tokens]
  Request 2: [800 shared tokens][200 unique tokens]
  Request 3: [800 shared tokens][200 unique tokens]

  Total prefill work:
    3 * 1000 tokens = 3000 token-units


With prefix reuse:

  Shared prefix:
    [800 shared tokens] computed once

  Unique suffixes:
    Request 1: [200 unique tokens]
    Request 2: [200 unique tokens]
    Request 3: [200 unique tokens]

  Total prefill work:
    800 + (3 * 200) = 1400 token-units
```

In this example, prefix reuse reduces prefill work by approximately 53%. The actual savings depend on prompt stability, cache residency, routing affinity, eviction pressure, and whether the request lands on a replica that still holds the matched prefix blocks.

The operational lesson is direct: stable prompt roots create reusable compute. Prompt churn destroys cache locality. System instructions, tool schemas, and long-lived output contracts should appear before dynamic user content whenever the application can safely structure prompts that way.

#### **Hashing and Key Extraction**

To achieve high-efficiency prefix caching, load balancers should route requests with shared stable prefixes to replicas likely to hold the matching KV-cache or radix-cache state. Routing by raw request count is insufficient because two requests with identical compute cost can have very different cache value depending on prefix overlap.

A cache-aware router extracts stable routing fields from the request and constructs a bounded routing key. The routing key should avoid highly volatile content that changes every turn, because over-sensitive hashing sends follow-up requests to cold replicas.

A practical routing-key pattern is:

```text
RoutingKey = Hash(
  model_id,
  adapter_id,
  tenant_scope,
  system_prompt_prefix[0..256],
  first_user_turn_prefix[0..256]
)
```

The proxy may tokenize the selected prefix window before hashing when token-level stability matters:

```text
prefix_tokens = Tokenize(
  system_prompt_prefix[0..256],
  first_user_turn_prefix[0..256]
)

target_rank = Hash(model_id, adapter_id, tenant_scope, prefix_tokens) % data_parallel_size
```

By ignoring later conversation turns, the routing key remains more stable across the session lifecycle. This increases the probability that follow-up requests land on the replica holding warm prefix-cache or KV-cache state.

This does not mean all dynamic content should be ignored for routing. Long-context requests, high-risk tasks, large tool schemas, tenant-isolated workloads, and region-bound data may still require routing overrides. The routing key is a locality heuristic, not a complete authorization or capacity decision.


#### **Prefill-Decode Disaggregation**

When serving heavy workloads, processing prompts (prefills) and generating tokens (decodes) on the same GPU can degrade performance.21 Prefills are compute-bound, saturating FLOPS; decodes are memory-bound, bottlenecked by memory bandwidth.11 Interleaving them on a single node causes head-of-line blocking and latency spikes.21  
Disaggregating these phases onto dedicated prefill and decode pools isolates execution.11 In a disaggregated deployment, a proxy coordinates the multi-step request flow: it dispatches the prompt to a prefill worker, waits for completion, transfers the resulting KV cache to a decode worker, and streams the generated tokens back to the client.21

| Doctrine: prefill is compute-bound; decode is memory-bandwidth-bound. Disaggregation improves   |
| throughput only when KV transfer and decode-side preallocation are cheaper than mixed-node      |
| head-of-line blocking.                                                                          |

To support disaggregated execution, SGLang manages specialized queues across prefill and decode instances.12

* **Prefill Instance Lifecycles:** Incoming requests enter the *Bootstrap Queue* to execute handshakes and pre-allocate memory on the decode node.12 They transition to the *Waiting Queue* to execute the compute-intensive prefill forward pass.12 Finally, they enter the *Inflight Queue*, where a non-blocking poll monitors the transfer status until the KV cache is fully transmitted to the decoder.12  
* **Decode Instance Lifecycles:** Requests enter the *Prealloc Queue* to initialize the receiver and pre-allocate physical KV blocks.12 They move to the *Transfer Queue* to poll the receiver until weight ingestion is complete.12 Once verified, requests land in the *Waiting Queue* to build a metadata batch that skips the prefill pass, and finally merge into the *Running Batch* for uninterrupted autoregressive token generation.12

These transfers run on high-performance backends like Mooncake (an RDMA-based transfer engine optimized for InfiniBand/RoCE) or NIXL (a UCX/libfabric plugin system).12 In write mode, the proxy dispatches to prefill and decode concurrently; the prefill node pushes the KV cache layer-by-layer directly into the decoder’s pre-allocated memory via RDMA writes as each layer is computed, minimizing transfer overhead.21  
Large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) deployments (e.g., DeepSeek-V3/R1) combine prefill-decode disaggregation with Wide Expert Parallelism (WideEP).42 These workloads rely on optimized collective communication kernels like DeepEP to handle expert-to-expert token routing, dual-batch overlap (DBO) to mask MoE dispatch overheads, and Expert Parallel Load Balancing (EPLB) weight shuffles to balance token routing skew across physical GPUs.42

## **Tenant-Aware Capacity & Architectural Isolation**

Multi-tenant enterprise serving architectures must protect hardware pools from the noisy-neighbor problem, where a single high-volume customer saturates shared GPU batch slots.2

* **Opaque Key Verification:** Resolves tenant identity at the gateway using hashed keys, matching requests to billing plans and routing tables.  
* **Token-Bucket Limits:** Enforces usage limits using Redis-backed sorted sets, preventing extreme token or request spikes.  
* **Weighted Fair Queues:** Sorts requests by priority and tenant tier, guaranteeing that premium users bypass background processing queues.2  
* **CUDA MPS Allocation:** Logically partitions GPU Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and memory limits, ensuring that tenant containers run isolated on shared hardware.2  
* **MIG Partitioning:** Provides physical, hardware-level isolation by partitioning the GPU silicon and memory bus into distinct, independent instances.10  
* **PCIe-Aware Placement:** Tracks host-level link contention, dynamically migrating active processes across physical cards to avoid PCIe bus hotspots.10

#### **Atomic Token-Locking to Prevent TOCTOU Races**

To prevent Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) races in high-concurrency environments, concurrency-slot acquisition must be performed as a single atomic operation. Multiple parallel requests must not be able to read the same active slot count before any of them writes the increment.

A Redis Lua script can acquire a tenant concurrency slot atomically:

```lua
-- Acquire a tenant concurrency slot.
-- KEYS[1] = tenant concurrency key
-- ARGV[1] = concurrency limit
-- ARGV[2] = slot TTL in seconds

local key = KEYS[1]
local limit = tonumber(ARGV[1])
local ttl = tonumber(ARGV[2])

local current = tonumber(redis.call("GET", key) or "0")

if current < limit then
    local next_count = redis.call("INCR", key)

    -- Ensure the key eventually clears even if a worker dies before releasing.
    if next_count == 1 then
        redis.call("EXPIRE", key, ttl)
    end

    return 1 -- Slot acquired.
else
    return 0 -- Limit exceeded.
end
```

The slot must also be released when the request completes, fails, times out, or is cancelled:

```lua
-- Release a tenant concurrency slot.
-- KEYS[1] = tenant concurrency key

local key = KEYS[1]
local current = tonumber(redis.call("GET", key) or "0")

if current <= 1 then
    redis.call("DEL", key)
    return 0
else
    return redis.call("DECR", key)
end
```

The acquisition script prevents burst traffic from bypassing concurrency limits. The release script prevents completed or cancelled requests from permanently occupying slots. The TTL protects against leaked slots when workers crash before cleanup.

This pattern should be paired with request IDs and idempotency keys when clients may retry. Without idempotency handling, a retry storm can acquire multiple legitimate slots for the same logical user operation.

#### **Hardware Isolation: MIG, MPS, and PCIe Contention**

While logical separation at the proxy protects queuing layers, heavy workloads can degrade performance at the physical layer.10 When multiple containers run concurrently on a shared GPU, they can trigger resource contention along the shared Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) fabric and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) domains, causing tail latency spikes and SLO violations.10  
To achieve deterministic execution, systems implement physical hardware isolation strategies:

* **Multi-Instance GPU (MIG):** Physically partitions the GPU silicon, HBM memory, and internal paths into distinct hardware instances.10 While MIG provides absolute compute and memory isolation, it does not isolate the shared PCIe bus, meaning intensive data transfers from background jobs can still bottleneck latency-sensitive inference runs.10  
* **Multi-Process Service (MPS):** Provides logical, software-level partitioning of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and memory limits.2 It is highly dynamic but offers weaker physical isolation than MIG.25  
* **PCIe-Aware Placement:** A host-level controller monitors tail latencies and PCIe bandwidth usage in a real-time feedback loop.10 If a tenant’s p99 latency exceeds its Service Level Objective (SLO), the controller migrates processes across physical cards, pinning process affinities away from IRQ-heavy host CPU cores and busy PCIe root switches.25 Combined with dynamic MIG reconfiguration and cgroup disk limits (io.max throttles), this optimization reduces SLO miss rates by approximately 32% and improves p99 TTFT tails by up to 15% under heavy I/O contention.10

## **Backpressure, Admission Control, and Quota Management**

When request volume outpaces available hardware capacity, model serving architectures must implement backpressure to protect GPUs from catastrophic failures and memory exhaustion.3 Admission control shifts the burden of queuing from the isolated model servers to the gateway.24

### **Backpressure and Admission Control Framework**

| Backpressure Strategy | Triggering Condition | Technical Implementation | Downstream Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Request Shedding** | Gateway queues or target backend pools exceed maximum wait times.3 | Rejects incoming requests immediately with an HTTP 503 error.3 | Drops low-priority traffic to protect active interactive streams.3 |
| **Priority Queuing** | Active backend pools report high HBM cache pressure.24 | Re-orders requests in the proxy plane using fair-share queues.24 | Automatically pauses background jobs during interactive traffic peaks.24 |
| **Constraint Clipping** | Incoming prompt lengths exceed target context windows.9 | Rejects payloads or truncates prompts before HBM allocation.8 | Avoids out-of-memory (OOM) failures on physical nodes.8 |
| **Automatic Downgrade** | Primary model execution fails or reports high queue latencies.8 | Redirects the active request stream to a smaller model replica.8 | Retries with a faster, cheaper local model to preserve availability.8 |
| **Async Deferral** | Saturated queues during peak interactive usage.3 | Bypasses the synchronous path; pushes payloads to an offline queue.3 | Delays batch processing to guarantee low latency for active users.3 |
| **Fail-Closed Path** | Detected security risks, template drift, or PII leaks.8 | Abruptly terminates the active execution thread and logs the error.8 | Blocks execution; returns a standardized HTTP 400 error. |

To enforce usage policies, platforms deploy rate limiters that track requests and dynamic execution metrics.

* **Requests Per Minute (RPM):** Monitored per tenant using sliding-window Redis sorted sets, rejecting bursts exceeding plans.  
* **Tokens Per Minute (TPM):** Tracks processed input and generated output tokens, soft-rejecting requests when limits are hit.  
* **Concurrent Requests:** Caps in-flight requests per user, holding excess calls in central queues to prevent thread exhaustion.  
* **Agent Recursion Limits:** Caps maximum sequential steps and tool executions inside agentic loops, halting runaway processes.  
* **Budget Ceilings:** Tracks calculated dollar costs per query, enforcing hard stops when monthly or daily spending limits are reached.

When backend systems are overloaded, poorly configured clients can trigger retry storms, compounding system pressure.28 To mitigate this risk, gateways enforce exponential backoff with randomized jitter and deploy circuit breakers that temporarily stop routing traffic to degraded zones, allowing them to recover.6

## **Elastic Scaling & Cold-Start Optimization**

Autoscaling for GPU workloads differs fundamentally from CPU-based services.9 While standard Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) trigger on CPU or system memory footprints, GPU runtimes saturate execution cores while keeping CPU metrics low, meaning CPU-based scaling fails to react before users experience massive latency spikes.9  
Autoscalers must evaluate GPU-native signals to scale capacity proactively.

### **Autoscaling and Cold-Start Model**

| Scaling Phase | Primary Metrics | Technical Execution | Latency Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Metric Extraction** | vllm:num_requests_waiting and gpu_cache_usage_perc.9 | Scrapes Prometheus-format endpoints via DCGM and engine monitors.9 | Proactively triggers scale actions before queue saturation degrades TTFT.9 |
| **Node Provisioning** | Compute resource requests and pending replica counts.7 | Karpenter on EKS provisions new GPU nodes in ~60 seconds.9 | Introduces structural lag; requires pre-allocated warm pools to buffer spikes.9 |
| **Weight Loading** | Weights size and network bandwidth availability.8 | Fetches model files from local registries; skips remote CDN retrievals.8 | Eliminates variable WAN download latencies; guarantees fast weight transfers.8 |
| **Runtime Init** | CUDA memory allocation and library load states.43 | Mounts images, loads models, and initializes the CUDA runtime.43 | Takes 10–30 seconds to initialize complex libraries. |
| **Optimized Capture** | Kernel compilation and CUDA graph capture steps.26 | Skip compilation with --enforce-eager or load templates via Foundry.26 | Cuts cold-start compilation overhead from minutes to under 4 seconds.26 |
| **Route Registration** | Host-level health-check passing states.6 | Verifies server readiness via mock runs before updating router tables.6 | Verifies node health before exposing it to active traffic.8 |

To protect users from cold-start latencies, architectures implement model residency strategies that map models to warm, on-demand, or batch tiers.

To optimize serverless cold starts, runtimes trade peak execution performance for fast startup times.43 For example, launching vLLM with the --enforce-eager flag skips time-consuming compiler optimizations and CUDA graph captures, reducing cold starts from 460 seconds to 219 seconds.43  
For massive deployments, context materialization platforms (such as Foundry) persist compiled execution templates and GPU state layouts offline, restoring them during scale-up to cut the initialization time of a 235B parameter MoE model from 10 minutes to 3.9 seconds.26 Some platforms also utilize snapshot-restore features, freezing a warmed GPU instance to disk and restoring its memory state on demand to bypass the initialization path entirely.43

## **Deployment Topologies: Cloud, On-Prem, Edge, Local, and Hybrid**

Selecting a deployment topology requires balancing tradeoffs across compliance, latency, cost, and maintenance complexity. The topology matrix below details these architectural options.

### **Deployment Topology Matrix**

| Topology | Capability Access | Latency Footprint | Operational Complexity | Cost Economics | Failure Modes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Managed APIs** | Immediate access to state-of-the-art frontier models.4 | High variability; vulnerable to WAN network jitter and rate limits.1 | Lowest; vendor manages scaling and infrastructure.4 | Pay-per-token pricing; expensive at sustained volumes.4 | Provider outages, quiet version updates, and pricing shifts.4 |
| **Cloud Self-Hosted** | High; deploy any custom-trained open weights.4 | Lowest latency via dedicated GPU nodes.9 | High; requires cluster scheduling and engineering.9 | Fixed hourly GPU costs; cheap at high, sustained usage.4 | Memory leaks, OOM crashes, and capacity provisioning delays.8 |
| **Private Cloud** | Custom limits based on internal hardware. | Low; constrained by localized interconnects. | Very High; requires dedicated system admins. | Capital expenditure model; high upfront costs. | Internal network congestion and hardware component failures. |
| **On-Premise** | Absolute control; custom model architectures. | Sub-millisecond localized execution. | Highest; team manages hardware lifecycle. | Maximum upfront CAPEX; zero recurring cloud fees. | Physical cooling faults and local power interruptions. |
| **Edge Deployment** | Constrained to small model footprints.4 | Deterministic localized latency. | High; sync configurations across distributed fleets. | Lowest; uses local client compute resources. | Local memory limits and update sync failures. |
| **Hybrid Systems** | Flexible model selection across pools.4 | Dynamic; route dependent.4 | High; requires unified gateways and routers.18 | Optimized; balances cheap local with costly remote.4 | Routing regressions and cascading failures.4 |

## **High Availability, Failover, and Degraded Modes**

Architectures must isolate failures proactively to preserve user-facing SLAs.8 If a component degrades, the serving platform must transition traffic immediately to healthy backups.27

### **High-Availability and Failover Model**

| Component | Primary Failure Mode | Immediate Detection Vector | Failover Strategy | Recovery Execution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inference Server** | GPU out-of-memory, CUDA fault, kernel crash, process exit, or unrecoverable preemption loop. | DCGM memory metrics, worker exit codes, SIGSEGV logs, OOM events, health probe failure. | Trip circuit breaker; stop routing new traffic to failed worker; shift queue to backup pool. | Restart container, lower context/batch pressure if needed, run smoke test, then reopen gradually. |
| **Model Registry** | Network timeout, checksum mismatch, stale artifact, unavailable registry, or failed mount. | Failed file-system mount, artifact checksum mismatch, missing model SHA, registry timeout. | Use warm snapshot or previous stable SHA; block new artifact promotion. | Resync registry, verify checksums, invalidate stale local cache, and restore normal promotion path. |
| **Artifact Store** | Weight files, tokenizer bundles, adapters, templates, or snapshots unavailable during scale-up. | Startup timeout, failed download, missing adapter, corrupted cache, readiness probe failure. | Keep prior active route; use locally cached artifact if checksum-valid. | Repair store, rehydrate local caches, rerun compatibility gate, and resume autoscaling. |
| **Model Router** | Classifier timeout, semantic-router failure, policy-table bug, or canary misrouting. | Router timeout, route-confidence collapse, validation failures, fallback spike, cost-per-success regression. | Bypass classifier; pin affected traffic to tenant-approved safe baseline route. | Roll back router policy, replay recent traces, restore canary only after validation. |
| **Load Balancer** | Loss of cache-affinity telemetry, bad endpoint state, or dispatch imbalance. | Empty backend metrics, prefix-hit collapse, uneven queue depth, p95/p99 latency skew by replica. | Fall back to least-loaded routing while preserving tenant and policy constraints. | Resync endpoint state, restore cache telemetry, gradually re-enable prefix-aware routing. |
| **API Gateway** | Edge-to-cloud disconnect, TLS/auth failure, regional outage, or gateway overload. | Downstream connection drops, client timeout spike, auth error surge, gateway saturation. | Route to geo-redundant secondary region or return clean 503 when no safe route exists. | Re-establish DNS and ingress paths, validate auth, then shift traffic back gradually. |
| **Telemetry Collector** | Shared buffer memory exhaustion, collector overload, or downstream metrics-store outage. | Rising packet drops, trace export latency, missing spans, collector queue growth. | Samples or drops noncritical telemetry while preserving audit-critical traces and raising an alert. | Restarts or scales collector pods, drains queued logs, and verifies audit-critical traces before clearing incident state. |
| **Validator / Policy Checker** | Schema validator, safety checker, grounding verifier, or action gate unavailable. | Validation timeout, retry storm, fail-closed spike, tool-call blockage. | Disable affected low-risk feature or fail closed for high-risk workflows. | Restore validator, replay held traces, confirm baseline failure rate before reopening. |
| **External Provider Route** | Provider outage, quota exhaustion, WAN failure, region block, or silent degradation. | Provider error codes, latency spike, degraded response quality, circuit-breaker trip. | Shift to approved secondary provider, local model, or degraded mode. | Verify provider health, compare output quality, and reopen through canary. |

High availability is not merely replica count. A serving platform is highly available only when it can detect failure, isolate the failing component, preserve safe user workflows, and recover without requiring live traffic to discover whether the replacement path works.

## **Serving Observability and Operations**

Observability in model serving must look beyond host-level CPU and memory footprints.3 Trace records must connect physical hardware performance back to active model versions and tenant identities, allowing SREs to isolate regressions instantly.1

This tracking model maps failures to their root causes, identifying bottlenecks across the stack.

### **Serving Failure Mode Map**

| Failure Scenario | Root Cause Mechanism | Immediate System Metric Impact | Operational Remediation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cold-Start Storm** | Concurrent node scale-ups download large model weights, initialize CUDA, compile kernels, or restore runtime templates at the same time. | Provisioning spike; TTFT rises sharply; readiness probes stay pending; weight-store bandwidth saturates. | Restore from warm snapshots or precompiled templates; stagger scale-ups; keep warm pools for high-SLO routes. |
| **GPU OOM Crash** | Long-context outliers, oversized batches, adapter pressure, or underestimated KV-cache growth exceed the memory envelope. | Worker exits; GPU memory metrics drop to zero after crash; OOM or CUDA allocation errors appear in logs. | Restart container; lower max context, batch size, or KV-cache fraction; route long-context requests to larger pools. |
| **KV Cache Exhaustion** | Active sequence count and context lengths consume all available paged KV blocks. | Free block count falls to zero; preemption/recompute spikes; ITL and TTFT degrade. | Reduce admission rate; lower active concurrency; route large-context traffic to separate lanes; add memory capacity. |
| **Cache-Affinity Collapse** | Router loses prefix-cache telemetry or prompt-template changes invalidate shared prefixes. | Prefix cache hit rate drops; TTFT rises; prefill FLOPS spike; warm replicas behave like cold replicas. | Restore prefix-aware routing; freeze prompt-template churn; rehydrate hot prefixes; temporarily route by stable hash. |
| **Router Regression** | Classification, semantic router, policy table, or canary split sends requests to unsuitable models. | Validation failures rise; fallback routes spike; cost per successful task increases; tenant complaints cluster by route ID. | Roll back routing policy; pin affected tenants to safe baseline route; replay recent traces against router candidates. |
| **Validation Retry Storm** | Model outputs fail schema, tool, or safety validators and trigger repeated retries or escalations. | Retry count rises; latency grows; downstream validator CPU increases; model route churn appears in traces. | Cap retries; fail closed for high-risk workflows; route to schema-specialized model; repair prompt or validator contract. |
| **Provider Fallback Loop** | Primary and fallback providers/routes fail or degrade in sequence, causing repeated route cycling. | Circuit breakers oscillate; external API error rates rise; latency and cost spike. | Break loop with explicit terminal degraded mode; pin to known-good route; disable failing provider until health recovers. |
| **Quota Counter Failure** | Redis, durable counters, or billing ledger becomes stale, slow, or unavailable. | Limit checks timeout; tenants exceed budget/concurrency; false rejections may appear. | Fail closed for unknown identity or high-risk tenants; use last-known-good limits for verified tenants; reconcile ledger after recovery. |
| **Artifact Registry Stale SHA** | Registry, artifact store, or deployment controller serves an old or mismatched model artifact. | Model SHA in traces diverges from release manifest; canary behavior does not match expected version. | Halt promotion; roll back to previous stable SHA; invalidate local artifact cache; verify checksums before reopening route. |
| **Prompt-Template Cache Bust** | System prompts, tool schemas, or formatting wrappers change too frequently, destroying prefix reuse. | Prefix hash cardinality rises; radix cache hit rate falls; TTFT increases across otherwise stable traffic. | Version and freeze prompt roots; move dynamic content after stable prefix; promote template changes through release gates. |
| **Prefill/Decode Transfer Backlog** | Disaggregated serving cannot move KV blocks from prefill nodes to decode nodes fast enough. | Transfer queue grows; decode pool waits idle; TTFT and ITL become unstable. | Increase transfer bandwidth; reserve decode-side KV blocks earlier; co-locate pools; fall back to mixed prefill/decode serving for affected routes. |
| **Queue Saturation** | Arrival rate exceeds available serving capacity or low-priority work competes with interactive traffic. | Waiting request count spikes; queue wait dominates TTFT; 429/503 rates rise. | Shed low-priority work; defer batch jobs; add replicas; adjust admission control and tenant priority lanes. |
| **Telemetry Drop** | Logging or tracing volume saturates collector buffers, network links, or metrics storage. | Packet loss; missing traces; collector queue growth; ClickHouse or metrics ingestion lag. | Sample noncritical telemetry; preserve audit-critical traces; scale collectors; decouple telemetry export from request execution. |
| **MIG Fragmentation** | Available GPU partitions do not match requested model or tenant profiles. | GPU capacity exists but pods remain pending; scheduler cannot place replicas. | Reallocate MIG profiles; maintain standard partition templates; route workloads to compatible pools. |
| **Tenant Noisy Neighbor** | One tenant monopolizes queue slots, KV cache, PCIe bandwidth, or adapter residency. | Tenant-skewed queue depth; p99 latency rises for unrelated tenants; GPU/HBM usage clusters by tenant. | Enforce per-tenant concurrency, TPM/RPM, and fair queues; move noisy tenant to isolated pool. |
| **Backpressure Failure** | Gateway continues admitting traffic after backend saturation. | Queue depth grows monotonically; retry storms begin; OOM and timeout rates rise. | Trip admission control; return clean 429/503; require client backoff with jitter; preserve premium and high-priority headroom. |

Failure-mode maps should be connected directly to operational runbooks. A failure row that does not produce a routing, rollback, scaling, or containment action is documentation confetti.

## **Cross-Canon Handoff Map**

The serving topologies, load balancers, quota policies, failover systems, and runtime traces established in AI-ENG-L provide the runtime foundation for downstream systems in the canon. AI-ENG-L does not merely describe where models run. It exports the operational contracts that other modules depend on: model routes, fallback paths, tenant identity, quota state, GPU-placement metadata, cache-affinity records, validation boundaries, telemetry traces, model SHAs, latency records, and rollback signals.

| **AI-ENG-AB** | Replayable Traces | Tokenized prefix hashes, session identifiers, release manifests, model SHAs, routing decisions, and fallback paths. | Reconstructs serving states to investigate regressions, incidents, and audit questions. |
| **AI-ENG-AC** | Incident Response Playbooks | Automated circuit breakers, health-check probes, containment actions, degraded modes, and recovery verification. | Triggers restarts, traffic shifts, rollback actions, and gradual route reopening after incidents. |
| **AI-ENG-AD** | Governance, Policy, Compliance & Accountability | Tenant contracts, data-residency rules, regulated-route approvals, model-access policies, audit boundaries, and exception records. | Ensures serving routes, fallback paths, degraded modes, and tenant isolation policies comply with governance requirements before promotion. |
| **AI-ENG-AE** | Infrastructure Efficiency | Radix-tree memory use, prefix-match distribution, GPU utilization, cache-hit optimization, and energy-per-token records. | Maximizes cache reuse and compute-to-watt efficiency across serving pools. |
| **AI-ENG-AH** | Build / Buy Strategy | Hosting cost matrices, latency profiles, topology constraints, provider fallback records, and operating-complexity evidence. | Evaluates managed API, self-hosted, hybrid, edge, and on-prem serving tradeoffs. |

The handoff rule is simple: AI-ENG-L exports the live runtime contracts that downstream systems use to govern tenants, tools, fallbacks, traces, incidents, evaluations, resource abuse, infrastructure efficiency, governance, and hosting strategy.

## **Core Doctrinal Principles**

To conclude this research report, the operational tenets of model serving architecture are synthesized into seven durable engineering principles.

### **I. Model Serving is Traffic Governance, Not Simple Hosting**

The serving stack must act as an intelligent gateway, managing requests across validation, security, and resource boundaries before allocating hardware cycles.1 Exposing raw inference endpoints directly to application consumers bypasses capacity management and risks system-wide cascades.2

### **II. Decouple the Control Plane from the Data Plane**

Changes to routing rules, deployment weights, tenant allocations, and fallback configurations must execute declaratively in the control plane.19 The data plane must focus exclusively on low-latency request execution, using zero-copy pipelines and stable metadata lookups to ensure high-performance streaming.5

### **III. Route Requests via Token and Memory Locality**

LLM serving is stateful by nature; the physical GPU hosting the warm KV cache is the most efficient execution target.5 Load balancers must route requests by analyzing tokenized prefix hashes, utilizing precise cache-state telemetry to avoid redundant prefill passes.23

### **IV. Enforce Multi-Tenant Isolation Down to the Silicon Layer**

Logical rate-limiting at the proxy is insufficient for heavy enterprise serving workloads.2 Platform teams must implement physical hardware partition boundaries, using MPS, MIG, and PCIe-aware process affinity placement to prevent cross-tenant performance interference and tail-latency degradation.10

### **V. Queue Centrally and Bind Late**

Holding requests centrally inside the load balancing plane avoids "scheduling regret," preventing high-priority tasks from getting stuck behind lower-tier requests in localized model queues.24 This delay allows the gateway to dispatch requests to the optimal replica at the last possible millisecond.24

### **VI. Proactive Autoscaling Demands GPU-Native Metrics**

Standard CPU and system memory footprint monitors fail to predict GPU compute bottlenecks.9 Platform operators must scale clusters based on model-specific parameters—such as waiting request queues and active HBM occupancy—to scale reactively before users experience latency spikes.9

### **VII. Plan for Degraded Grace over Absolute Failure**

In high-dimensional serving environments, network drops, hardware faults, and budget exhaustion are inevitable.27 Serving platforms must map detailed fallback routes, dynamic model downgrades, and cached response states to maintain availability even during partial outages.4
